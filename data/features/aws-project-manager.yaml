description: "You have an AWS project and need a Project Manager to make it happen?  You only need a couple hours a week or maybe full-time, but you want the option?  Together we can identify the number of hours a week you require, what deliverables you want, what responsibilities your Project Manager should take, and much more.  We are flexible and will adapt to your needs."
