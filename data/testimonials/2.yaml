text: "We don't always look around us, but sometimes the closest people to us are the ones that can provide real support. Estelle has many years experience accompanying entrepreneurs build and launch their companies. From the start she has challenged us and often said the exact opposite of what we wanted to hear. She is intelligent, direct and very experienced. Her support has guided us on a better route and with her success is inevitable."
