text: "When I started my career in IT as a system and network administrator for a large ISP, I had no idea it would take me so far.  As I progressed in my knowledge and in my roles I realized more wasn't enough for me.  After a re-orientation period, I have set my new goal on building a business based on highly skilled individuals, the elite of the market.  We will find these profiles and if we can't, then we will teach them!  [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veroniqueheitor/)"
