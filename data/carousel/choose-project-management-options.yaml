  "Isn't it better when you can choose exactly what you need?  I want a Project Manager for 7 hours a week for 12 weeks.  I want the "Essential" plan with all it's deliverables but also add a SWOT Analysis.  I want a Technical Introduction to Information Technologies at start to easier follow my project."
