This is just a quicky blog post to admit I have been defeated.  I have abandonned doing business in France and Switzerland to avoid any conflicts with a future competetor.  So yes, sorry France, which I know wouldn't have been easy to sell to you anyway, I have to give you up.  And Switzerland, which was on my "let's see list", I'll never find out if doing business with you is good.  So now, I don't need to translate any of my documents/presentations/contracts... in french!  Nor does my website need to be in french.  In the end, this is not so bad after all :-)
