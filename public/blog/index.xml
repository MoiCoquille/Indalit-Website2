      <title>Business Plan</title>

      <description>My Business Plan Like any serious future business owner, one does a business plan. This may seem like a small thing, but it&amp;rsquo;s a crazy document to complete, which makes you write a bunch of other documents/excel sheets. You also need to do a market research which I honestly have been ignoring. But if you do all that correctly, then your business is sure to thrive. Once you have finished the business plan, all you need to do is push &amp;ldquo;PLAY&amp;rdquo; and it all happens because everything is ready to go.</description>

      <description>Ugliness After working on the website for over a week, maybe even two, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but find it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the right look. I&amp;rsquo;ve redone the packs page/pages a few times and I&amp;rsquo;m still not happy with them. I know I will have to continue working on them tomorrow. The homepage template is great, perfectly corporate, but the images in the carousel and the formatting of the text just don&amp;rsquo;t cut it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to be a web developer, graphic designer and writer. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely better at HTML and CSS, but not the design and content part. So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to accept the not so perfect pages, they may not look top notch professional but they will do the job. In the end, what will matter is the service we give and not the design of our web site. As for content, I guess &amp;ldquo;INTERNET&amp;rdquo; will need to deal with the more direct approach and finally give up on all the bullshit keywords and phrases.</description>

      <description>We have a new logo. It&amp;rsquo;s actually just an update, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a new logo.

While we are on the subjet, let us explain the meaning of our logo. It actually comes from something and wasn&amp;rsquo;t just created from nothing, it has a meaning. And yes, the cloud is part of the source and has not been added to match the services we offer. Wikipedia will explain it better than I will, Indalo story on Wikipedia.</description>

      <description>How Does It Work Now? When you create a BLOG post, you can use a template file you have created with all the possible TAGS and CATEGORIES (for example), there might be a better way to handle this with Hugo, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t even looked. This post is not about creating a template for all BLOG posts, but only for a certain type of BLOG posts. If you want a specific HTML formatting for only specific types of BLOG posts, then you need to add it to your template file.</description>

      <description>I need to start this by saying there is NO bug with AWS CloudFront, NO bug with AWS S3, NO bug with Hugo and NO bug with OWL Carousel javascript. This is a Veronique bug. I just wanted to document this in case someone has a similar problem. I was unable to find the solution on the internet with the search strings I used.
Environment  Hugo Static Website Generator version v0.</description>

      <description>It’s time for another update. I’m still a web developer for now, it’s taking much more time than planned. The good news is yesterday I sat down and started to write HTML with nested DIVS and formatting all over the place without any hesitation, just came out like I’ve been doing it for some time. I know this won’t last, when I’m done, it will go away as fast as it came, but I’m proud of myself.</description>

      <title>Amazon EBS Volumes Delete on Instance Termination</title>
      <link>https://www.indalit.com/blog/2018/02/18/aws-ebs-instance-termination/</link>

      <description>Did you know that by default Amazon Web Services EBS root device volumes are automatically deleted when the instance terminates?
This is also the case with ephemeral storage (instance store volumes). Other non root EBS volumes are not deleted. You can configure your instance so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t delete the EBS root device volumes with the DeleteOnTermination attribute.</description>

      <description>On my previous post I was working on www.indalit.com. First of all, I, innocent me, actually thought I was finished. But then, I made the mistake at looking at the page with my mobile phone!!! And then making my browser screen smaller!!! Wow, horrible. So, it turns out working with CSS and positioning correctly DIVs is just not a beginners thing. Took me hours of work. Now it works great, but my associate has decided it needs to be centered.</description>

      <description>As you probably don&#39;t know, I am creating/making/writing/configuring www.indalit.com using an open source static site generator called Hugo. I&#39;ve chosen a theme and moved forward from that. The small glitch is I&#39;m am NOT a web developer at all. I&#39;ve learned Python for fun and mostly forgot since I haven&#39;t been practicing, but that&#39;s all my experience in the development world. So working on this site has been a great challenge for me; Hugo provides a theme, but that&#39;s just the base and after that you have a lot of modifications to do.</description>

      <description>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s official, we are starting the process of creating our company. I assume this will take a few months, but I am not in a hurry. At this stage roles are not clear, so I go with the flow. For now, I seem responsible for the design/creation and configuration of our website Indalit.com and it&amp;rsquo;s content. So, I decided on having a blog. Inicially thinking it will look professional, be a good place to publish what I write about AWS and help with SEO.</description>

      <description>Did you know when you use the default termination policy with AWS Auto Scaling it doesn’t terminate the instance with the oldest launch configuration automatically? It first tries to balance the number of instances across Availability Zones, then picks the Availability Zone with the most instances and terminates the instance with the oldest launch configuration. If there are more than one, then it ends the process by randomly picking the instance to terminate.</description>
