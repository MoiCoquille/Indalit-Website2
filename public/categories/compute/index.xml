      <title>Amazon EBS Volumes Delete on Instance Termination</title>

      <description>Did you know that by default Amazon EBS root device volumes are automatically deleted when the instance terminates?
This is also the case with ephemeral storage (instance store volumes). Other non root EBS volumes are not deleted. You can configure your instance so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t delete the EBS root device volumes with the DeleteOnTermination attribute.
You can find more information on this AWS EBS feature at What happens to an EBS volume when the instance is terminated?</description>

      <title>AWS Auto Scaling Termination Policy</title>
      <link>https://www.indalit.com/blog/2017/06/13/aws-autoscaling-termination-policy/</link>

      <guid>https://www.indalit.com/blog/2017/06/13/aws-autoscaling-termination-policy/</guid>
      <description>Did you know when you use the default termination policy with AWS Auto Scaling it doesnâ€™t terminate the instance with the oldest launch configuration automatically? It first tries to balance the number of instances across Availability Zones, then picks the Availability Zone with the most instances and terminates the instance with the oldest launch configuration. If there are more than one, then it ends the process by randomly picking the instance to terminate.</description>
