      <description>Did you know that by default Amazon Web Services EBS root device volumes are automatically deleted when the instance terminates?
This is also the case with ephemeral storage (instance store volumes). Other non root EBS volumes are not deleted. You can configure your instance so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t delete the EBS root device volumes with the DeleteOnTermination attribute.</description>
