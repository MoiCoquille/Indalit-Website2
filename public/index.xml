      <description>We have a new logo. It&amp;rsquo;s actually just an update, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a new logo.

While we are on the subjet, let us explain the meaning of our logo. It actually comes from something and wasn&amp;rsquo;t just created from nothing, it has a meaning. And yes, the cloud is part of the source and has not been added to match the services we offer. Wikipedia will explain it better than I will, Indalo story on Wikipedia.</description>

      <description>How Does It Work Now? When you create a BLOG post, you can use a template file you have created with all the possible TAGS and CATEGORIES (for example), there might be a better way to handle this with Hugo, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t even looked. This post is not about creating a template for all BLOG posts, but only for a certain type of BLOG posts. If you want a specific HTML formatting for only specific types of BLOG posts, then you need to add it to your template file.</description>

      <description>Did you know that by default Amazon Web Services EBS root device volumes are automatically deleted when the instance terminates?
This is also the case with ephemeral storage (instance store volumes). Other non root EBS volumes are not deleted. You can configure your instance so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t delete the EBS root device volumes with the DeleteOnTermination attribute.</description>

      <description>Did you know when you use the default termination policy with AWS Auto Scaling it doesn’t terminate the instance with the oldest launch configuration automatically? It first tries to balance the number of instances across Availability Zones, then picks the Availability Zone with the most instances and terminates the instance with the oldest launch configuration. If there are more than one, then it ends the process by randomly picking the instance to terminate.</description>

      <description>I always have a lot to write about, it&#39;s just a question of time. I tend to write about anything, no specific subjects even though I try and stay in the Project Management, IT Technologies and Cloud Services universe. Yes this is a professional BLOG, but there is no reason one can&#39;t enjoy himself. We are a human company and thus do human things. My entry point for the Public Cloud world was AWS Services.</description>

      <description>What Are Custom Options? Custom Options are Deliverables and/or Tasks that exists in the Plans. You have more than hundred Steps in all the a&amp;gt; + extra ones that are not part of any Phases. Many of the Steps are either a Deliverable or a Task. For example, you may want to have a Project Plan done but nothing else. It&amp;rsquo;s common for customers to take a Plan and add Custom Options to it to build their own Project Management Services.</description>
