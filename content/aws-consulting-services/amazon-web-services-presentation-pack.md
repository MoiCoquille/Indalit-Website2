What is the AWS Presentation Package?
</h4>

<h5 class="font03">
Need to know quickly who is Amazon Web Services?  Need to understand what they do?  We will present to you exactly that, giving you the knowledge to move forward with AWS.  The AWS Presentation Package is composed of the following: 

<br /><br />

<ul class="ul-01">
	<li><span style="color:#a8a8a8">Introduction to AWS and it's main services</li>
	<li><span style="color:#a8a8a8">Questions & Answers session</li>
	<li><span style="color:#a8a8a8">Follow-Up session</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="font04">
What will you get from it?
</h4>

<h5 class="font03">
You will understand what is the AWS Cloud, who is AWS, what does AWS do, how much does AWS cost, what are AWS main services and probably a bit more.  You will be confident enough to move forward on your AWS project or have enough knowledge to decide AWS is not for you. 2 hours well spent, a bit intensive, but rewarding.
