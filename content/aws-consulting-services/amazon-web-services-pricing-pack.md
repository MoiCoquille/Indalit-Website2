What is the AWS Pricing Package?
</h4>

<h5 class="font03">
The world of AWS is amazing, high quality services, almost too many to choose from,...  But understanding pricing is not as simple as one may think.  You have a already designed solution by us or not.  We calculate the price.  The package is composed of the following:

<br /><br />

<ul class="ul-01">
    <li><span style="color:#a8a8a8">An Investigation</li>
    <li><span style="color:#a8a8a8">Presentation of the first estimate</li>
    <li><span style="color:#a8a8a8">Presentation of the second estimate</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="font04">
What will you get from it?
</h4>

<h5 class="font03">
First of all peace of mind, if you where to do it yourself, you'd be surprised by the complexity and time required.  You will get an unofficial quote of one-of charges and monthly recurring charges.  With this you will have an overall appreciation of the cost reduction you will make with AWS.

What is included?
</h4>

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-4">
<h4 class="font05">Your Architect and Your Participants</h4>
<h4 class="font03">
The pricing of your infrastructure will be handled by an AWS Certified Solutions Architect. To have an effective Q&A session, you can have up to 4 participants. Only basic IT knowledge required, we will not go into technical details.
</h4>
</div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
<h4 class="font05">Investigation</h4>
<h4 class="font03">To price correctly, we need to know a lot of details about your expected usage.  This can only be provided by you.  We will work with your teams to gather this data.</h4>
</div>

<div class="col-md-4">
<h4 class="font05">First Estimate Presentation</h4>
<h4 class="font03">Through a Video Conference Call we will present the estimation an explain the details.  At this stage you might be surprised and wish to make some modifications to fit your budget.</h4>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
<h4 class="font05">Second Estimate Presentation</h4>
<h4 class="font03">We often get over excited when building a solution but when it comes time to price it, we calm down rapidly.  This second estimate might be required to get a better price or to be able to compare.  Do note this is not a second solution that is priced, but the initial one with minor modifications.</h4>
</div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
<h4 class="font05">Duration</h4>
<h4 class="font03">This packages includes a maximum of 4 hours.  It is only for small infrastructures with the primary AWS services.  We can provide a list.</h4>
</div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
<h4 class="font05">Caveats</h4>
<h4 class="font03">Pricing is provided based on AWS website.  We have no tool or application that allows us to have the most accurate prices.  Also good thing to note is we do not work for AWS and receive no commission from them, so no point in trying to negotiate.  Pricing is strictly provided based on usage predictions given by your teams.  These numbers may not represent the reality.</h4>
