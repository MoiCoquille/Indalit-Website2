## Introduction

<td>We could write all the industry keywords, the usual bla that actually says nothing about who you 
are and what to do. Even worse, now you have many sites in the AWS Services and Cloud Services sector
, more than you can imagine, that build their site and it's content around buzzwords and you can't ev
en figure out what they do exactly, what they are trying to sell. Now maybe when you consider your cu
stomer to be the CEO or CFO and not someone with technical knowledge, maybe these sites make sense to
 them, but that is not the way we want to go. We prone communication and transparency in our way of m
anaging your projects, so it is natural that we would do it all the way. We give openly show you what
 we offer, what you get, how we do it and more, in exchange for your trust. We practice what we preac
h.</td>

## Why our own Project Management Methododoly? 
Main ObjectivesYou will find in our methodology a lot or rules and guidelines, but none of them ab
out actually doing a good project plan or other typical Project Management tasks. Here is why. Projec
t Management is our job and we do it well. It may sound pretentious, but in the end it's actually pretty easy. We consider these tasks to be something we cannot do wrong. How many times have you been to
 the dentist and he couldn't clean your teeth correctly? Personnaly, never happened. Obviously he knows how to do the basic tasks of his job, and so do we. But, you've probably been to see dentists that
 you didn't like and didn't go see them again. Now that is what counts. The base is easy, doing a good job is easy, but doing a great job is not the same, and that is what we want to do. That is what is
 special about our Project Management Methodology. It's built for greatness, good is no enough, or at
 least there is no challenge in it. So what we want is the following:


<ul style="color:#d84315">
	<li><span style="color:grey">Be great Project Managers</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">Our customer come back over and over again</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">We have fun doing our job, we learn, we keep getting better and everyone, or almost everyone, is 
happy.</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">Our Projects are Successes (required for 3 previous points)</li>

</ul>


## Plans 

For our Project Management Methodology to be great AND adapted to Cloud Services and more specific
ally AWS Services, it had to be homemade. All methodologies that exist have their advantages and disa
dvantages. None are specifically made for Cloud Services. So we took the best out of Agile, Scrum, Le
an, Prince2,... and left the bad. We also need something adaptable for a more "efficient"offering for
 customers with limited budgets. Now we offer four different Project Management Plans:




<center><img src="/img/pm-methodology/indalit-pm-plans.png" alt="A Project Manager giving you the option between plans with cookies, pie and cake" height="300" /></center>






We also have a forth possibility which is not a Plan per say, but an option to pick and choose what PM tasks you want to be done.  This is the Custom selection, let's call it a Plan just for the sake of it.  With these four Plans, it is impossible for our customers to not get what they want. There is the minimum, "Essential Plan", which offers what is necessary to have a successful project. If your looking for a SWOT Analysis for example, you're going to have to move up in the Plans. The important thing is you have the option for limited budget. The "Prime Plan" and "Integral Plan" obviously offer each a little more then the one before.  And the last, "Custom Plan", you get to pick and choose what you want, with the "Essential Plan" as bare minimum (our Project Managers need some mandatory tasks to do their job correctly, like having a Project Plan). What is interesting to know is that you don't necessarily pay more for a "Prime Plan" than an "Essential Plan". Let me explain. If you have a project with 50 AWS EC2 Instances and 6 AWS RDS databases with AWS S3 and AWS CloudFront, but you take the "Essential Plan", you will pay more than a "Prime Plan" with 8 AWS EC2 Instances and 2 AWS RDS Databases. The calculation is solely based on weekly hours required to run the Project. The bigger your Project, the more hours needed in a week to manage it.  The more Indalit Project Management Services you take, the more hours needed in a week to do them.  The more AWS Services you want, the more hours needed to organise the tasks. It's all about the hours a week.


## Project Phases 

Our Methodology has 8 phases, and yes Sales is part of the Phases. Why? Because during that stage 
we are already gathering information about your project that will allow the Project Manager to manage
 your project. So the methodology starts there. If for some reason we didn't have a Sales phase in a 
project, then we would be missing valuable information. We aim to go above and beyond the usual basic
 Project Management offering, that is why there is a Project Idea Phase and you could probably add In
itate Phase to that. That being pre-launch project activities for which a Project Manager is not alwa
ys solicitated. We will look later at some Rules and Guidelines, but one of the principale caractheri
stic of our methodology is to not ask more than once the same information. For example, the project S
cope, you find this in almost all PM documents, so it's easy to write it over and over again. But we 
get this information during the Sales Phase, it gets processes into the system, has it's own place an
d can and will get used throught the project, it is easy accessible and always at the same place. As 
a customer you will have a few forms to fill depending on the Phase, but you will not find the same q
uestion twice. And the stored data is not immutable, it can be updated throughout the Project by vari
ous team members. In the end we all work together to achieve a common goal, a successful project.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Project Idea</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">No need to go into the Sales Phase, should be pretty obvious. Let's go see the Project Idea Phase.
 Here our customer has an idea or undefined goal like "should we move our e-commerce site from our traditionall hoster to a Cloud Service Provider?". "Or maybe we should only move the content management since we have hundred of thousands of pictures, videos and documents?" Our customer is now faced with at least two possible projects. He can choose to do neither, or pick one of the two. To make sure he makes the right decision and more precisely has all the necessary information to take that decision
, he needs to go throught a process of analysis of each potential project. We can walk you throught the Project Idea Phase, investigate, research, analyse each option. When working with us, once you make it to the end of the Phase, you know you will have taken the best decision for your business. It's not just a question of technology, you have to consider if your company is Cloud Ready, is the project is good for the business depending on it's current status and financial situation, does your team h
ave time to work on a new project, will it fit in your current processes, ... and so on. Most project that fail didn't have a proper feasability analysis done.</td>

<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Initiate</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">In the phase our customer already has his project idea. If all was prepared correctly, then a few 
documents already exists. Examples are New Project Proposal, Project Charter, Gap Analysis, or a Business Plan... Now we look at the project in more technical details, SOW, Deliverables,... And finally, we can manage for you the choice of suppliers, RFI/RFP and Contract negotiation. We bring you to the stage where you have all the elements in hand to either go with the project and just put things into motion in the next Phase, Assess or drop the project because it doesn't have all the requirements to be approved internally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Assess & Plan</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Now we get serious! This is often where your Project Manager starts, the two previous Phases are optional. Again, if things where done correctly there is some documentation available for the Project Manager to start his knowledge aquisition stage (he needs to understand the project). But don't worry, if nothing exists he knows how to figure it all out. There are a few deliverables in the Assess &amp; Plan Phases, many of which are optional. These Phases are the most important, the Project Manager must understand your project correctly to Plan adecately. This is why your involvement during the Assessment is so crucial.</td>

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Implementation</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">This one is easy, just run the Plan, stay alert, adapt, track,... We offer specific tests per AWS 
Service and we can also build the tests for your own applications and infrastructure. This is a Value Added Service that comes from our specialization in AWS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Integrate</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Not taken seriously to it's full extent. Most see the integration into your companies technical su
pport or escalation procedures, but always related to the technical aspects. In realite, integrating a Cloud Solution affect most of your departments. Things are done differently and your company will need to adapt. So here we look at things like proper recruitement (HR), provisioning, change requests, internal/external communication (marketing), finance,... We can work with you on all of these aspects to kickstart your new experience with AWS Services.</td>

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Finalize</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Here we celebrate, your project is a success and you can now move onto a new one, hopefully with us.</td>

## Based on What? 

But now you wonder, where does this methodology actually come from? We mentionned Agile, Prince2 a
nd more, but what exactly?

### Agile 

This is the most popular Project Management Methodology. We wouldn't call it methodology but more 
guidelines. It's main target is software development projects, but we can still learn from it. It is 
actually a manifesto with 12 points. You can see our BLOG POST on AGILE MANIFESTO. Without going into details, here are the main guidelines of Agile and how we have used them.

<br />

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;"><center>AGILE PRINCIPLE</center></td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;"><center>HOW WE INTEGRATE IT</center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Customer Statisfaction Throught Early and Continuous Delivery.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Where it makes sense, we delivery in smaller components, but the reality is when delivering an Infrastructure, even if you get a part of it, it's not necessarily useful. If you get a Load Balancer but no web servers, or web servers without the database, or the database without the backup solution, and it goes on. It has to be used sporadically because it can be counter productive. Imagine your web servers where delivered two months ago with all the test that where possible at that time, now you are ready to add the Load Balancer but it doesn't work, something wrong with the web servers. But your eng
ineer that worked on the web servers is now on another project and the new engineer knows nothing about the installation. He needs to take the time to audit and investigate to get up to speed. In the end, you waste a lot of time when delivering an infrastructure in this manner. You can also consider the tests done on the web servers are inadecuate since they don't represent the actual solution, another waste of time. But it's not all black, they are cases where this Agile guideline is useful in an In
frastructure Project, especially if we also Project Manage your software development necessary for your Cloud Implementation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Adapt to changes </td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Many older methodologies don't really allow for changing requirements. On short term projects this is less of an issue, but larger implementations often change during the Project Management Life Cycle. We adapt to change, it's part of our methodology, if during the implementation of your solution you decide to add a new service that has an impact on the deployment, then we will replan the project accordingly has per the changes management guideline that we established at the start of the project. This will obviously have an impact on the delivery date, costs,... but do note that it is an option you have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Again on frequent delivery but this time in a shorter time.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">What we have taken from this is to divide into smaller chunks the work to be done. So instead of a few large successes, there will be many smaller ones. This allows for splitting the work between different people instead of relying on one person. It is also more motivating to work this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Business people and engineers must work together daily throughout the project.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">We put in place an extensive communication plan. To be efficient, no more meeting with the Busine
ss people, then the engineers, then the suppliers,... The more each team member understand the project, the more chance it has to be a success. We even offer courses to bring up to speed non technical team members to finally understand what a CDN is or how DNS works, so they can participate fully. For the more technical people, we offer courses on how Pricing and Procurement work or how the full cycle of project management is done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Motivation, support and trust.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Communication again is the key to motivation and providing support for the team members. If you s
tay close to them, they will feel involved and valued. As for trusting them, that's another story. You might have found this at some point "Plan according to the fact that people are incompetent". When outsourcing, which is often the case for Cloud Projects, at least the Project Management with us, you can't build the same relationships you could if you worked together for years. This means, as the Project Manager, you have no clue if your team members are competent. Because of this, our methodology is based on the contrary, don't trust but build incompetence into the Project and deal with it in a way that it won't have a negative impact on the project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Face-to-face conversations </td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">This just doesn't work in todays multi location projects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Working software is the primary measure of progress.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">ell, now if we adapt this one to a more infrastructural projet, we are then looking at deliverables and tests being the primary measure of progress. This is obvious, what else would be the measurement?  This is like saying "When you take a step, you move forward, backword or sideways"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Promote sustainable development. Keep a constant pace indefinitely.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Not applicable to the work we do since it is on a per project basis. Once you implement your new AWS solution or your migration is complete, the project work is finished and it's just a question of maintenance and change management. In development projects, you always have new functionalities to developpe, you never really stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. </td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Quality work. This can only be achieved with competent teams in all aspects of a project, not just the technical one. We border, or better said guide all teams to keep them on track and working at their best. As mentionned above, we have integrated into our methodology how to deal with incompetencies so it doesn't have a negative impact on the project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Simplicity</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">If you knew more about our methodology you would be amazed at how easy and simple it is. It's been built around dealing with incompetence, and yes this also includes our Project Manager. In reality, it is very complex, but so well done that for everyone, again including our Project Managers, don't realize the complexity and see it as something easy. Only I know that it is an imposing piece of work. It's like many AWS Services, you put them in place in two or three clicks and off you go, but behing the scene they are actually very elaborate and not at all simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">he best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">ince we are not really involved in the architecture, requirements and design, we can't integrate this into our methodology.  We are dependent on what was done before being involved in the project.<
/td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Reflect on how to become bore effecient, adapt your methodology.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">This might not be done at the customer level since for you it's pretty much a one time thing. But at 
the end of the project, when we enter the Finalize Phase, we look at our work and see what could have been done better, what have we learned and how to update our process. We work on an Open Source mindset, we all participate and add to our methodology. It might be a new template for testing an AWS Service or it might be the addition of a new step in a Phase.

### Some Others

Here are a few others we use some aspects of the methodology in ours.  

<br />

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Scrum</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Software development projects.  Very innovative methodology.  In the garbage everything from the past, ...but, why is everything from the past no good?  Shouldn't we learn from the issues and keep the good?  Anyway, from Scrum we do keep a few things. 

1) What does DONE mean, what are the acceptance criterias? Always be very clear on what is required before being able to change the status of a task to DONE.
2) Daily Scrum.  Difficult remotely on sometimes limited Project Management hours, but we have added to our daily activities to communicate with team members actively and make sure they have what they need to move forward.

Not so much, but again, this methodology is oriented around software developement.  You can probably adapt it to more types of projects, but they require a certain number of requirements that are not applicable to all projects.  Like being on-site for the Daily Scrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Waterfall</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">It's getting a lot of bad publicity compared to Agile, but again because people don't really know what it is.  We don't use anything from it, not at all adapted to our type of projects.  That is not completely true.  Waterfall documents intensively, we offer all the industry standard documents either part of the plan you choose or as an option.  We do not prone documentation which tends to be repetivie, but we put in our methodology a way of dealing with information to avoid duplication.  We give the customer the choice of what he needs for his business and not what a specific methodology would impose.  Waterfall in software development, where people tend to  compare it to Agile, is a catastrophe.  It is absolutely unflexible and aims at having a "Big Bang" huge delivery after months and months of work.  In software development, during those months, modifications, new features, and more have risen, but couldn't be added to the project.  Now, if you take a bridge construction project or a new type of mobile to be manufactured, you wouldn't want half way to change anything major since it would have an impact on other parts of the project.  In manufacturing and construction for example, this methodology can be effective.  It's a question of using it in the right context.  Which is exactly the case for all methodologies, they are adapted to certain types of projects, just like ours. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Lean</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Muda, getting rid of waste.  We have an Essential Plan, which is the minimum you need to run a successful project.  All extras have been eliminated to have the most efficient plan as possible. 
Muri, removing overload so nothing slows down.  We don't do the same thing twice, everything is processed, we clear away the obstacles to allow the team members to move forward, we eliminated uncessary steps and if in demand anyway, it is still available as an option.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Prince2</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">A more classic methodology to Project Management, lot's to learn from it.  We took many of the deliverables (documents) from this methodology.  Since they are the most popular ones, we wanted to offer what customers want and what customers want it what they are use to getting.  For example, the Communication Management Strategy, could you really do without?  We actually don't depend on it but it's part of the process.  Our methodology is based on communication, communication, communication, so we want to communicate with EVERYONE, keeping them all informed in the same way.  Now obviously this doesn't work for every customer, some are based on a very hierarchal structure and thus don't share between teams.  We can adapt.  In resume, we take a lot from Prince2 but not all of it is used by default.</td>
</tr>

We could keep going and look into PMP, Extreme Programming,... but in the end, it always comes down to taking the best and leaving the rest.															
															
Now we have only scratch the surface of how we manage your projects.  We offer a more indepth course on participating in a project run by an Indalit Project Manager.  It's short and consice, easy to follow and will defenitely have a beneficial impact on how we  will work together with your teams and the suppliers.  If you know what to expect from us, then we can move faster, avoid conflicts have more chances of a successful project.  It's all about communication.  Knowledge is the key.
