## Why Specialise In Cloud Services?

A mixture of many factors, but in the end, we discovered <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS</a> a few years ago and fell in love with it, they are just amazing at what they do.  From there came the interest in <i>Cloud Services</i> in general.  And finally, traditional hosting is dying and there is a lot of work to be done and we can get it done.


## Based On What? 

But now you wonder, where does this methodology actually come from? We mentionned <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#agile">Agile</a>, <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#prince2">Prince2</a> a
nd more, but what exactly?

### Agile 

This is the most popular <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#pmmethodology">Project Management Methodology</a>. We wouldn't call it methodology but more guidelines. It's main target is software development projects, but we can still learn from it. It is actually a manifesto with 12 points.  Without going into details, here are the main guidelines of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/principles.html" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a> and how we have used them.

<br />

<td style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">AGILE PRINCIPLE</td>

<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Customer Statisfaction Throught Early and <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#continuous-delivery">Continuous Delivery</a></th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Where it makes sense, we delivery in smaller components, but the reality is when delivering an Infrastructure, even if you get a part of it, it's not necessarily useful. If you get a Load Balancer but no web servers, or web servers without the database, or the database without the backup solution, and it goes on. It has to be used sporadically because it can be counter productive. Imagine your web servers where delivered two months ago with all the test that where possible at that time, now you are ready to add the Load Balancer but it doesn't work, something wrong with the web servers. But your engineer that worked on the web servers is now on another project and the new engineer knows nothing about the installation. He needs to take the time to audit and investigate to get up to speed. In the end, you waste a lot of time when delivering an infrastructure in this manner. You can also consider the tests done on the web servers are inadecuate since they don't represent the actual solution, another waste of time. But it's not all black, they are cases where this Agile guideline is useful in an <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#infrastructure-project">Infrastructure Project</a>, especially if we also <i>Project Manage</i> your software development necessary for your <i>Cloud Implementation</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Adapt to changes </th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Many older methodologies don't really allow for changing requirements. On short term projects this is less of an issue, but larger implementations often change during the <i><i>Project Management</i> Life Cycle</i>. We adapt to change, it's part of our methodology, if during the implementation of your solution you decide to add a new service that has an impact on the deployment, then we will replan the project accordingly has per the changes management guideline that we established at the start of the project. This will obviously have an impact on the delivery date, costs,... but do note that it is an option you have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Again on frequent delivery but this time in a shorter time.</th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">What we have taken from this is to divide into smaller chunks the work to be done. So instead of a few large successes, there will be many smaller ones. This allows for splitting the work between different people instead of relying on one person. It is also more motivating to work this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Business people and engineers must work together daily throughout the project.</th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">We put in place an extensive communication plan. To be efficient, no more meeting with the Busine
ss people, then the engineers, then the suppliers,... The more each team member understand the project, the more chance it has to be a success. We even offer courses to bring up to speed non technical team members to finally understand what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network" target="_blank">CDN</a> is or how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" target="_blank">DNS</a> works, so they can participate fully. For the more technical people, we offer courses on how Pricing and Procurement work or how the full cycle of <i>Project Management</i> is done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Motivation, support and trust.</th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Communication again is the key to motivation and providing support for the team members. If you s
tay close to them, they will feel involved and valued. As for trusting them, that's another story. You might have found this at some point "Plan according to the fact that people are incompetent". When outsourcing, which is often the case for <i>Cloud Projects</i>i>, at least the <i><i>Project Management</i></i> with us, you can't build the same relationships you could if you worked together for years. This means, as the <i>Project Manager</i>, you have no clue if your team members are competent. Because of this, our methodology is based on the contrary, don't trust but build incompetence into the Project and deal with it in a way that it won't have a negative impact on the project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Face-to-face conversations </th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">This just doesn't work in todays multi location projects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Working software is the primary measure of progress.</th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Well, now if we adapt this one to a more <i>Infrastructural Projet</i>, we are then looking at <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#deliverable">Deliverables</a> and tests being the primary measure of progress. This is obvious, what else would be the measurement?  This is like saying "When you take a step, you move forward, backword or sideways"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Promote sustainable development. Keep a constant pace indefinitely.</th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Not applicable to the work we do since it is on a per project basis. Once you implement your new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a> solution or your migration is complete, the project work is finished and it's just a question of maintenance and change management. In development projects, you always have new functionalities to developpe, you never really stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. </th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Quality work. This can only be achieved with competent teams in all aspects of a project, not just the technical one. We border, or better said guide all teams to keep them on track and working at their best. As mentionned above, we have integrated into our methodology how to deal with incompetencies so it doesn't have a negative impact on the project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Simplicity</th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">If you knew more about our <i>Cloud Solutions Project Management Methodology (CPM)</i> you would be amazed at how easy and simple it is. It's been built around dealing with incompetence, and yes this also includes our <i>Project Manager</i>. In reality, it is very complex, but so well done that for everyone, again including our <i>Project Managers</i>, don't realize the complexity and see it as something easy. Only I know that it is an imposing piece of work. It's like many <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS Services</a>, you put them in place in two or three clicks and off you go, but behing the scene they are actually very elaborate and not at all simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Since we are not really involved in the architecture, requirements and design, we can't integrate this into our methodology.  We are dependent on what was done before being involved in the project.<
/td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Reflect on how to become bore effecient, adapt your methodology.</th>
<td style="width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">This might not be done at the customer level since for you it's pretty much a one time thing. But at 
the end of the project, when we enter the Finalize Phase, we look at our work and see what could have been done better, what have we learned and how to update our process. We work on an Open Source mindset, we all participate and add to our methodology. It might be a new template for testing an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS Service</a> or it might be the addition of a new step in a Phase.

### Some Others

Here are a few others we use some aspects of their methodology in our <i>Cloud Solutions Project Management Methodology (CPM)</i>.  

<br />

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;"><a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#scrum">Scrum</a><br /><img src="/img/pm-methodology/scrum-postit-are-you-serious.png" alt="Scrum Postit, are you serious" height="150" /></th>
<td style="width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">Software development projects.  Very innovative methodology.  In the garbage everything from the past, ...but, why is everything from the past no good?  Shouldn't we learn from the issues and keep the good?  Anyway, from Scrum we do keep a few things. 
<ol>
	<li><span>What does DONE mean, what are the acceptance criterias? Always be very clear on what is required before being able to change the status of a task to DONE.</li>
	<li><span><a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#daily-scrum">Daily Scrum</a>.  Difficult remotely on sometimes limited <i>Project Management</i> hours, but we have added to our daily activities to communicate with team members actively and make sure they have what they need to move forward.</li>
</ol>
Not so much, but again, this methodology is oriented around software developement.  You can probably adapt it to more types of projects, but they require a certain number of requirements that are not applicable to all projects.  Like being on-site for the Daily Scrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;"><a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#waterfall">Waterfall</a></th>
<td style="width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">
	It's getting a lot of bad publicity compared to Agile, but again because people don't really know what it is.  We don't use anything from it, not at all adapted to our type of projects.  But maybe that is not completely true.  <i>Waterfall</i> documents intensively, we offer all the industry standard documents either part of the <i>Project Management</i> <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">Plan</a> you choose or as an <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Project Management Custom Options</a>.  We do not prone documentation which tends to be repetivie, but we put in our <a href="/project-management-methodology/">Cloud Solutions Project Management Methodology (CPM)</a> a way of dealing with information to avoid duplication.  We give the customer the choice of what he needs for his business and not what a specific methodology imposes.  
<br />
<i>Waterfall</i> in software development, where people tend to compare it to <i>Agile</i>, is a catastrophe or appears to be (we have no experience in it).  It is absolutely unflexible and aims at having a "Big Bang" huge delivery after months and months of work.  In software development, during those months, modifications, new features, and more change requests have risen, but can't be added to the project.  Now, if you take a bridge construction project or a new type of mobile to be manufactured, you probably wouldn't want to change anything once the project implementation has started.  Manufacturing and construction sectors are examples where this methodology can be effective.  It's a question of using it in the right context.  Which is exactly the case for all methodologies, they are adapted to certain types of projects, just like ours. Even though you could probably use our methodology to renovate your house, it would work, but it's a question of what is the best and not what works.

<tr>
<th style="width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;"><a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#lean">Lean</a></th>
<td style="width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;"><a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#muda">Muda</a>, getting rid of waste.  We have an <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/#essential">Essential Plan</a>, which is the minimum you need to run a successful project.  All extras have been eliminated to have the most efficient <i>Project Plan</i> as possible. 
<br />
<a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#muri">Muri</a>, removing overload so nothing slows down.  We don't do the same thing twice, everything is processed, we clear away the obstacles to allow the team members to move forward, we eliminated uncessary steps and if in demand anyway, it is still available as an option.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;"><a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#prince2">Prince2</a></th>
<td style="width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">
A more classic methodology to <i>Project Management</i>, lot's to learn from it.  We took many of the deliverables (documents) from this methodology.  Since they are the most popular ones, we wanted to offer what customers want and what customers want it what they are use to getting.  For example, the Communication Management Strategy, could you really do without?  We actually don't depend on it but it's part of the process.  Our methodology is based on communication, communication, communication, so we want to communicate with EVERYONE, keeping them all informed in the same way.  Now obviously this doesn't work for every customer, some are based on a very hierarchal structure and thus don't share between teams.  We can adapt.  In resume, we take a lot from <i>Prince2</i> but not all of it is used by default.

We could keep going and look into <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#pmp">PMP</a>, <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#extreme-programming">Extreme Programming</a>,... but in the end, it always comes down to taking the best and leaving the rest.

## Project Phases 

Our <i>Cloud Solutions Project Management Methodology (CPM)</i> has 8 <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#phase">Phases</a>, and yes Sales is part of the <i>Phases</i>.  Why?  Because during that stage we are already gathering information about your project that will allow the <i>Project Manager</i> to manage your project. So the methodology starts there. If for some reason we didn't have a <i>Sales Phase</i> in a project, then we would be missing valuable information. We aim to go above and beyond the usual basic <i>Project Management</i> offering, that is why there is a <i>Idea Phase</i> and you could probably add <i>Initate Phase</i> to that. That being pre-launch project activities for which a <i>Project Manager</i> is not always solicitated. We will look later at some rules and guidelines, but one of the principale caractheristic of our <i>Cloud Solutions Project Management Methodology (CPM)</i> is to not ask more than once the same information. For example, the <i>Project Scope</i>, you find this in almost all Project Management documents, so it's easy to write it over and over again. But we get this information during the <i>Sales Phase</i>, it gets processes into the system, has it's own place and can and will get used throught the project, it is easy accessible and always at the same place. As a customer you will have a few forms to fill depending on the <i>Phase</i>, but you will not find the same question twice. And the stored data is not immutable, it can be updated throughout the Project by various team members. In the end we all work together to achieve a common goal, a successful project.

<td style="width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">
Let's go see the <i>Idea Phase</i>.  Here you have an idea or undefined goal like "should we move our e-commerce site from our traditionall hoster to a <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#cloud-service-provider">Cloud Service Provider</a>?". "Or maybe we should only move the content management since we have hundred of thousands of pictures, videos and documents?" You are now faced with at least two possible projects. You can choose to do neither, or pick one of the two. To make sure he makes the right decision and more precisely has all the necessary information to take that decision, he needs to go throught a process of analysis of each potential project. We can walk you throught the Idea Phase, investigate, research, analyse each option. When working with us, once you make it to the end of the Phase, you know you will have taken the best decision for your business. It's not just a question of technology, you have to consider if your company is <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#cloud-ready">Cloud Ready</a>, is the project is good for the business depending on it's current status and financial situation, does your team have time to work on a new project, will it fit in your current processes, ... and so on. Most project that fail didn't have a proper feasability analysis done.
<i>Idea Phase</i> added to get involved early on in the project while it is still just an idea or a few ideas.  At this stage we can already consider multiple <i>Cloud Service Providers</i>.  Besides the usual <i>Project Idea</i> study, we analyze your requirements and identify which <i>Cloud Service Providers</i> is best adapted to them doing a <i>Cloud Service Provider Evalutions</i>.

In this phase our customer already has his Idea. If all was prepared correctly, then a few documents already exists. Examples are <i>New Project Proposal</i>, <i>Project Charter</i>, <i>Gap Analysis</i>, or a <i>Business Plan</i>... Now we look at the project in more technical details, <i>SOW</i>, <i>Deliverables</i>,... And finally, we can manage for you the choice of suppliers, <i>RFI/RFP</i> and Contract negotiation. We bring you to the stage where you have all the elements in hand to either go with the project and just put things into motion in the next Phase, Assess or drop the project because it doesn't have all the requirements to be approved internally.

<td style="width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;">
Now we get serious! This is often where your <i>Project Manager</i> starts, the two previous <i>Phases</i> are optional. Again, if things where done correctly there is some documentation available for the <i>Project Manager</i> to start his knowledge aquisition stage (he needs to understand the project). But don't worry, if nothing exists he knows how to figure it all out. There are a few deliverables in the <i>Assess</i> &amp; <i>Plan Phases</i>, many of which are optional. These <i>Phases</i> are the most important, the <i>Project Manager</i> must understand your project correctly to plan adecately. This is why your involvement during the <i>Assess Phase</i> is so crucial.

This is by far a <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-value-added-services/">Project Management Value Added Service</a>.  <i>Project Managers</i> are usually involved when a project hasn't been launched into production.  But the reality is once in production, a project is not necessarily ready to be handed over.  There is still a lot of work to be done.  During the project, the <i>Project Manager</i> was probably involved in preparing your business to manage this change, or at least should.  HR, provisioning, recruitment, support, change management and much more need assistance in this new Cloud Implementation which is usually not something they have done before.  To make the transition from project to production and assist during the first couple of months to make sure everything is in place, who better than the <i>Project Manager</i> who usually is the person with the most knowledge on the subject.  Example of tasks can be change management process, support documentation, incident escalation process, but he can do so much more.  His role is not to make the link between your business and your <i>Cloud Service Provider</i>, but to make your <i>Cloud Infrastructure</i> part of you business.
