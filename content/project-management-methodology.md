## A Bit About Our Mindset
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
We could write all the industry buzzwords, the usual chatter that actually conveys nothing about who you are and what to do as a company. You brows certain sites and just can't find what they offer exactly.  Maybe to more Business oriented roles these sites mean something to them.  At Indalit we have chosen to take a different approach.  As Project Managers we are particuarly good at organizing, giving clear messages and most importantly communicating.  Can you imagine Project Managers running your project without being clear on anything, communicating very little and disorganized?  We prone transparency in our way of managing your projects, so it is natural that we would do it all the way on our <a href="https://www.indalit.com" target="_blank">Website</a>, our <a href="https://twitter.com/indalitcloud" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/indalit-cloud-consulting" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and our <a href="/blog/">BLOG</a>.  We will give you the foundations of our services, so you can make a educated decision.  Others would say, give very little information so they have to call and get caught in the sales process.  We think efficiency first, why waste time if what your looking for is not what we offer.

## Why Our Own Project Management Methododoly? 

Because we offer new types of {services}, a {pay per hour model}, with defined {Project Management Plans} to choose from and even the option to pick and build your own {Custom Project Management Deliverables}.  You will find in our {Project Management Methodology} lots or {rules} and {guidelines}, but none of them about actually doing a good {Project Plan} or other typical Project Management {Tasks}. Here is why. Project Management is our job and we do it well. It may sound pretentious, but in the end it's actually pretty easy. We consider this work to be something we cannot do wrong. How many times have you been to the dentist and he couldn't clean your teeth correctly? Personnaly, never happened. Obviously he knows how to do the basics of his role, and so do we. But, you've probably been to see dentists that you didn't like and didn't return. Now that is what counts. The base is easy, doing a good job is easy, but doing a great job takes effort, and that is what we aim for. That is what is special about our {Project Management Methodology}, it's built for greatness, good is no enough. With it, what we want is the following:


<ul style="color:#d84315">
	<li><span style="color:grey">Be great Project Managers (QUALITY)</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">Customers come back (CUSTOMER SATISFACTION)</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">Projects are a Success (PERFORMANCE)</li>
</ul>

<!-- **************** -->

## Our Services

### Quality, Not Low Cost

Even though we are a more economical solution, we are not a low cost.  Your cost will always be lower if need less hours compared to a full-time Project Manager.  And if you do need a full-time Project Manager, we have very competetive prices compared to a full-time {freelance} Project Manager.  Obviously if you compare to a full-time employee, we are not the best alternative.  We have degressive pricing, the more hours a week you take and the more weeks you need, then the lower the cost.  But our {business model} is to provide quality work and be recognized for it.

### Our Plans 

For our Project Management Methodology to be great AND adapted to Cloud Services and more specifically <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS Services</a>, it had to be homemade. All methodologies that exist have their advantages and disadvantages. None are specifically made for Cloud Services. So we took the best out of Agile, Scrum, Lean, Prince2,... and left the bad. We also need something adaptable for a more "efficient"offering for customers with limited budgets. Now we offer four different Project Management Plans:


<center><img src="/img/pm-methodology/indalit-pm-plans.png" alt="A Project Manager giving you the option between plans with cookies, pie and cake" height="300" /></center>


We also have a forth possibility which is not a Plan per say, but an option to pick and choose what PM tasks you want to be done.  This is the Custom selection, let's call it a Plan just for the sake of it.  With these four Plans, it is impossible for our customers to not get what they want. There is the minimum, "Essential Plan", which offers what is necessary to have a successful project. If your looking for a SWOT Analysis for example, you're going to have to move up in the Plans. The important thing is you have the option for limited budget. The "Prime Plan" and "Integral Plan" obviously offer each a little more then the one before.  And the last, "Custom Plan", you get to pick and choose what you want, with the "Essential Plan" as bare minimum (our Project Managers need some mandatory tasks to do their job correctly, like having a Project Plan). What is interesting to know is that you don't necessarily pay more for a "Prime Plan" than an "Essential Plan". Let me explain. If you have a project with 50 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2</a> Instances and 6 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">Amazon RDS</a> databases with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">AWS S3</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon CloudFront</a>, but you take the {Essential Plan}, you will pay more than a {Prime Plan} with 8 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2</a> Instances and 2 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">Amazon RDS</a> databases. The calculation is solely based on weekly hours required to run the Project. The bigger your Project, the more hours needed in a week to manage it.  The more Indalit Project Management Services you take, the more hours needed in a week to do them.  The more <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS Services</a> you want, the more hours needed to organise the tasks. It's all about the hours a week.

For a more detailed description of offering, click here {Project Management Plans}.


### Our Custom Options

The {Plans} have been well designed and most should find in one of them what they require.  But it's always nice to have the option for more.  There are 3 situations in which you would consider the {Custom Options}:

<ol style="color:#d84315">
	<li><span style="color:grey">{Plan} + {Custom Options} (You pick a {Plan} and add one or more {Custom Options} deliverables because your business requires them.</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">{Custom Options} for management your project ({Essential Plan} will be added, the Project Manager has some tasks he cannot remove to be able to do his job correctly.)</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">One or more {Custom Options} (Get a few deliverables for an existing project not managed by us.) </li>
</ol>

For a list of the {Custom Options}, click here {Custom Options}.


### Our Value Added Services - Going Beyond Project Management

This is where we stand out.  Amazon, a few years back, realized technically they where pretty good.  They built a great e-commerce platforme that was serving, not sure of the numbers, a crazy amount of customers all over the world.  So someone had the idea, why not sell our expertise?  And from that came AWS and the empire it has become.  It's the same for us.  To create a methodology that was adapted to the constraints of the IT industry and Cloud Services Provider, a lot of work was done, processes put in place, documentation, templates and so much more.  It had to work large scale, it had to be adapted to the IT recruiting difficulties, to integrate project team members that mostly work from different locations, to handle very demanding customer and so much more.  So many of our {Value Added Services} come from the whole Indalit proccess.  Training sessions is an example of them.

One of the key character traits of project managers is that they can get things done even if they have never done it before and don't know how, or have no training on the subject, in the end they will make it happen.  They don't resist change like many do, they are leaders and leaders move forward.  With this sort of attitude, we decided to offer some {Value Added Services} that are outside of the normal Project Management scope simply because we have the experience and knowledge to do much more.

### Pricing

Calculated # of hours per week and # of weeks.
But how do we know how many hours a week is necessary?

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="/img/pm-methodology/project-management-on-demand-prices.png" alt="Sitting on a Euro, Time is Cash" height="275" />&nbsp;
<td>
PLANS: Pricing is based on number of hours a week you need and the number of weeks you reserve them for.  Price is degressive.  Minimum 7 hours a week for a minimum of 1 month.  This is for {Project Management Services} where you take a {Plan}. 
<br /><br />
CUSTOM OPTIONS: Price is per hour, each option has a minimum number of hours.  Price here is based on the work that needs to be done, the size of the solution and the complexity of each {Cloud Service}.
<br /><br />
VALUE ADDED SERVICES: They are priced similarly to the {Custom Options}, based on work load, the infrastructure size and the complexity of each {Cloud Service}.  We even have one training session that is free because it will make the project must smoother.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Internal staff not Cloud Ready.  But worse, not interested to change, change is a scary word.  And this is for all your departments, Engineering of course, but HR, Sales, Marketing, Provisioning, Finance,...
<br />
We have training sessions to get people going.  {How Amazing is the Cloud?}, {Introduction to Cloud Providers}, {Introduction to AWS}, {Technical Introduction to AWS}, {Finally I Learn the Basics of IT},... all these are presentations to get you started.  They are designed to motivate and show the positive aspects.  From there, we can build a training path for your employees with sepcialized training centers or self-learning.  With the goal of having a few certifications.

Following the previous point, your teams are not ready but you need to move forward.  We will work with you to find the resources you require to get this project done.  In the {Idea Phase} or {Initiate Phase}, once we have identified a few suppliers we can work with, we use an {RFI} and/or {RFP} to gather the necessary information to enable us to choose the right one.  We also create the {Supplier Assessment Checklist} that matches your requirements.

We start with you a bit earlier in the project process to provide support and guidance from the moment you have an idea or many.  And we go beyond the {Implementation Phase} to assist you on a day to day basis for the first couple of months, {Assist Phase}.  You can be certain that we cover all aspects of your project.

There are so many options, how do we know what to choose?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We will analyse with you the possible options adapted to your requirements.  This will be done working with your teams or the suppliers.  Based on the goal of your project, we can choose the options most relevant to start with.  We can keep a "nice to have" list and plan this in multiple stages.  This should ideally be done in the {Initiate Phase}.

How much will it cost?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We price out the whole solution for you, recurring and implementation.  We can then adjust both to match your budgets before even starting the project.  No surprises.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
If we where involved early enough in your project, we can make sure the solution proposed is the one that will work.  It is easy to follow a budget, but the problems come from badly planned projects where not enough effort was put into an initial audit and design.  Once the project has been approved, the suppliers chosen, the infrastructure designed, the project manager can only manage the budget based on the assumption that everything was done correctly before.  Often the project manager is brought in too late.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
As mentionned before, we offer training sessions aimed to helping people want to make the change.  Putting together a training path to motivate them, following their progress and providing support will definetely help onboard them.  But in the end, some people will be completely resistent to change.

We will prepare all the necessary documents that will allow you to present the project in a very professional way.  All will be covered and should answer all their questions and doubts.  It's not a guarantee of approval, but definetely a way of giving the project the best chance possible.

</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We work with suppliers like this.  We have put in place a process to make it work which we can adapt to all non-english speaking technicians.  This will require someone on their side who does speak english, it will take some time to setup and will be more intensive to manage, but it is possible.  Considering you pay 900€/day for an AWS Solutions Architect, you could find the same level of expertise starting at 250€/day.  For some this can be worth the hassle.
</td>

<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Project management can be expensive, can we do without?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Some would say on a small project you can do without, but in any case you will need someone to be the main contact if you want it to work.  Noone to take the role of a Project Manager will cause delays, budgets will not be followed, people won't be managed, and in the end, even if your project is a success, there will be many aspects missing and the project will most likely have taken longer and cost more than planned.  To help with this, we offer Project Management on a per hour a week basis.  If you only need 10 hours, then you don't have to pay the full price of a Project Manager.  On the other hand, you need a full time Project Manager, we will most likely be less expensive then market rates.  Our prices are based on the number of hours taken a week and the number of months of the contract.  In both situations, you will pay less going with us.

<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
On our last project, we lost control over it.  How can we avoid this happening?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Get us involved at an early stage of the process.  Ideally during the {Idea Phase}.  The more the Project Manager is involved, the better he can do his job.  Our methodology is completely adapted to Cloud Services and we have experience in this.  As long as you take the right number of hours of Project Management, there is no reason to lose control over the project.

<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Moving to the Cloud, we are affraid of Vendor Lock-In.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
This problem has nothing to do directly with a Cloud solution.  If you went with a traditional hoster you would have the same problem.  If this is something you are afraid of then consider an on-premises solution.  But it is true that if you use the full extent of Cloud Services available to you, then moving will be more difficult than a traditional hoster which offers very little services.  What we can do for you to limit this, is to be involved early in your project, the {Idea Phase} and we can investigate a multi-cloud solution.  This will most likely cost more to setup, but can give you some peace of mind.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We think the Cloud is less secure than on-premises or a traditional hosting solution.  
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
This can only be analysed on a case by case basis.  On-premises security definitely rarely meets the security standards of a Cloud Provider.  As for traditional hosting, it really depends.  It is true you will probably have a lot of data on the Cloud.  It can be encrypted at rest and encrypted in transit, does your traditional hoster do this?  This is just an example.  But if you need to be reassured, we can analyze your security requirements and see how the Cloud Provider you choose deals with it.

Managing Multiple Cloud Services
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
One, two or more Cloud Providers doesn't change anything for us.  All we need is the time to manage it.  The role of a Project Manager is to manage people, so they can be working on different aspects of the project, that won't affect us in any way.
</td>

<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We've been told it is very complex to build a Cloud Solution.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Entirely depends on your project.  A simple e-commerce migration will be easy, a change of methodology, technology like moving your applications to a serverless solution will obviously be more complex.  But for us, it's the same except there are more milestones/tasks/steps to manage.  That is our role.

<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Will my Cloud Solution have better performance than my current one?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Again, if we are included in the project early on, we can plan for a POC and test various performance indicators.  The only constraint is this needs to be planned early on because if the outcome is negative, the whole project will be affected.  The order of things will be adapted to the fact there is a POC in the project.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We have been told that the monthly cost keep going up when on a Cloud Solution, but that the cost of the traditional hosting is fix.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
This is a perfect example of needing to do things in a new way once you have moved to the Cloud.  You need to start with calculating the cost per unit (unit being # of customers, of users, or transactions...)  Month to month you compare that cost.  If it goes up, then something is wrong, but normally it should go down.  We can help you create your monthly financial analysis for your Cloud Solution.  Just to give you some background on this, when you have a traditional hosting solution your prices are fixed.  When traffic goes up and your site slows down, you loose some users/customers or whatever, you infrastructure is unable to adapt.  On a Cloud Solution, which was designed correctly, a boost in traffic means more users/customers since the infrastructure adapts to this burst.  In the end you usually have more users/customers that come directly from this ability to adapt to traffic.  You can add to this less downtime, less attacks, ... and it is normal to expect some growth when moving to the Cloud.

We have done our own cost analysis and a Cloud Solution is not cheaper.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We can do one for you.  We have done many and thus have experience in this.  It is unusual for a Cloud Solution to be more expensive than an on-premises one or a traditional hosting one.  A few errors in calculating the cost are usually done which make a big difference on the bottom line.  First, when you buy servers, you generally pay upfront or maybe lease them over X number of years.  You need to compare with the same type of pricing plan.  So if you pay upfront, the compare with the Cloud Providers pricing plan that matches this.  Most people calculate with the on-demand cost which are very expensive compared to paying a full upfront for a 3 years contract.  This is usually where the mistake is made.  Then, you are moving to the Cloud, there are all these new amazing services, so you take a couple of them that will in the end take you less time to manage, save you some money on other aspects like licensing and so on.  But when you make your calculation, you can't compare apples with pears.  A new service that is not part of your current infrastructure cannot be calculated in your cost analysis.  Also, depending on the Cloud Provider, the cost of services can be very difficult to estimate.  The whold Cloud Solutions is an amazing revolution, a new way of doing things much more efficiently.  The Cloud Providers have done a great job at creating inovative services, quality and usability as primary characteristics.  But, how to calculate the actual cost of your future infrastructure can be a nightmare.  It often gives you the impression they used all their good energy in developping amazing services, then they had nothing left and did crazy things with calculating costs.

We can plan for this in the project, choose the suppliers, help with training your teams, assist you in the first couple of months of production, build your processes and much more.

You can see it as a huge project and be completely overwhelmed by it, or as a multitude of small ones.  The {Waterfall} project management methodology which delivers a project in one big band approach is avoided when possible.  Now we are more in the era of {Continuous Delivery}/{Continuous Integration}.  What this means is we try to deliver in increments, small chuncks at a time.  In the end, this make take a bit more time, but you have much more chances of success then a big bang delivery.  We will plan for more deliveries but smaller ones.  This methodology is based on the {Agile Manifesto}.

</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Testing is expensive.  If you test every step of the way, you need someone to design the tests, perform them, get any issues fixed and then start testing again until it works.  Tests should be planned and prepared, another reason to make sure you involve your Project Manager early one.  We can have the tests created, we can manage a mix of tests being prepared by the suppliers, your teams and your Project Manager, your Project Manager can create the tests and cherry on the cake, we have some tests ready for different services.

Obviously it should be part of your project, but in the case you can't afford a proper DR solution, we can help you build a solution on paper.  What does this mean?  Well, you will have a complete "How To" to build a DR site on the fly in X amount of time.  This obviously can take a lot of time, but much less than if it wasn't planned.  For example have all the {Server Images} ready.  Have all the options of a services identified with correct values and so on.

## Why A Cloud Project Management Methodology?

Is it better to be generaliste and do a bit of everything well?  Or is it better to be a specialiste and do a lot of one thing very well?  We choose the latter.  Now, we can do very well with existing Project Management Methodologies but we can do extremely well with a perfectly adapted to Cloud Services one.  The answer is simple, it was the only way to excell.

<!-- ____________________________________________________________ -->

# Why Specialise in Cloud Services?

A mixture of many factors, but in the end, we discovered AWS a few years ago and fell in love with it, they are just amazing at what they do.  From there came the interest in Cloud Services in general.  And finally, traditional hosting is dying and there is a lot of work to be done and we can get it done.

<!-- ____________________________________________________________ -->

# The Methodology

<!-- **************** -->

## Based on What? 

But now you wonder, where does this methodology actually come from? We mentionned Agile, Prince2 a
nd more, but what exactly?

### Agile 

This is the most popular Project Management Methodology. We wouldn't call it methodology but more 
guidelines. It's main target is software development projects, but we can still learn from it. It is 
actually a manifesto with 12 points.  Without going into details, here are the main guidelines of Agile and how we have used them.

<br />

<table>

<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Customer Statisfaction Throught Early and Continuous Delivery.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Where it makes sense, we delivery in smaller components, but the reality is when delivering an Infrastructure, even if you get a part of it, it's not necessarily useful. If you get a Load Balancer but no web servers, or web servers without the database, or the database without the backup solution, and it goes on. It has to be used sporadically because it can be counter productive. Imagine your web servers where delivered two months ago with all the test that where possible at that time, now you are ready to add the Load Balancer but it doesn't work, something wrong with the web servers. But your eng
ineer that worked on the web servers is now on another project and the new engineer knows nothing about the installation. He needs to take the time to audit and investigate to get up to speed. In the end, you waste a lot of time when delivering an infrastructure in this manner. You can also consider the tests done on the web servers are inadecuate since they don't represent the actual solution, another waste of time. But it's not all black, they are cases where this Agile guideline is useful in an In
frastructure Project, especially if we also Project Manage your software development necessary for your Cloud Implementation.</td>

<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Adapt to changes </td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Many older methodologies don't really allow for changing requirements. On short term projects this is less of an issue, but larger implementations often change during the Project Management Life Cycle. We adapt to change, it's part of our methodology, if during the implementation of your solution you decide to add a new service that has an impact on the deployment, then we will replan the project accordingly has per the changes management guideline that we established at the start of the project. This will obviously have an impact on the delivery date, costs,... but do note that it is an option you have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Again on frequent delivery but this time in a shorter time.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">What we have taken from this is to divide into smaller chunks the work to be done. So instead of a few large successes, there will be many smaller ones. This allows for splitting the work between different people instead of relying on one person. It is also more motivating to work this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Business people and engineers must work together daily throughout the project.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">We put in place an extensive communication plan. To be efficient, no more meeting with the Busine
ss people, then the engineers, then the suppliers,... The more each team member understand the project, the more chance it has to be a success. We even offer courses to bring up to speed non technical team members to finally understand what a CDN is or how DNS works, so they can participate fully. For the more technical people, we offer courses on how Pricing and Procurement work or how the full cycle of project management is done.</td>

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Motivation, support and trust.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Communication again is the key to motivation and providing support for the team members. If you s
tay close to them, they will feel involved and valued. As for trusting them, that's another story. You might have found this at some point "Plan according to the fact that people are incompetent". When outsourcing, which is often the case for Cloud Projects, at least the Project Management with us, you can't build the same relationships you could if you worked together for years. This means, as the Project Manager, you have no clue if your team members are competent. Because of this, our methodology is based on the contrary, don't trust but build incompetence into the Project and deal with it in a way that it won't have a negative impact on the project.</td>

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">ell, now if we adapt this one to a more infrastructural projet, we are then looking at deliverables and tests being the primary measure of progress. This is obvious, what else would be the measurement?  This is like saying "When you take a step, you move forward, backword or sideways"!</td>

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Promote sustainable development. Keep a constant pace indefinitely.</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Not applicable to the work we do since it is on a per project basis. Once you implement your new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a> solution or your migration is complete, the project work is finished and it's just a question of maintenance and change management. In development projects, you always have new functionalities to developpe, you never really stop.</td>

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Quality work. This can only be achieved with competent teams in all aspects of a project, not just the technical one. We border, or better said guide all teams to keep them on track and working at their best. As mentionned above, we have integrated into our methodology how to deal with incompetencies so it doesn't have a negative impact on the project.</td>

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">If you knew more about our methodology you would be amazed at how easy and simple it is. It's been built around dealing with incompetence, and yes this also includes our Project Manager. In reality, it is very complex, but so well done that for everyone, again including our Project Managers, don't realize the complexity and see it as something easy. Only I know that it is an imposing piece of work. It's like many AWS Services, you put them in place in two or three clicks and off you go, but behing the scene they are actually very elaborate and not at all simple.</td>

the end of the project, when we enter the Finalize Phase, we look at our work and see what could have been done better, what have we learned and how to update our process. We work on an Open Source mindset, we all participate and add to our methodology. It might be a new template for testing an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS Service</a> or it might be the addition of a new step in a Phase.

<br />

### Some Others

Here are a few others we use some aspects of the methodology in ours.  

<br />

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;"><center>Scrum <br /><img src="/img/pm-methodology/scrum-postit-are-you-serious.png" alt="Scrum Postit, are you serious" height="150" />&nbsp;</center></td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Software development projects.  Very innovative methodology.  In the garbage everything from the past, ...but, why is everything from the past no good?  Shouldn't we learn from the issues and keep the good?  Anyway, from Scrum we do keep a few things. 
<br /><br />
1) What does DONE mean, what are the acceptance criterias? Always be very clear on what is required before being able to change the status of a task to DONE.
<br />
2) Daily Scrum.  Difficult remotely on sometimes limited Project Management hours, but we have added to our daily activities to communicate with team members actively and make sure they have what they need to move forward.
<br /><br />
Not so much, but again, this methodology is oriented around software developement.  You can probably adapt it to more types of projects, but they require a certain number of requirements that are not applicable to all projects.  Like being on-site for the Daily Scrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;"><center>Waterfall</center></td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
	It's getting a lot of bad publicity compared to Agile, but again because people don't really know what it is.  We don't use anything from it, not at all adapted to our type of projects.  But maybe that is not completely true.  Waterfall documents intensively, we offer all the industry standard documents either part of the {Plan} you choose or as an {Custom Option}.  We do not prone documentation which tends to be repetivie, but we put in our methodology a way of dealing with information to avoid duplication.  We give the customer the choice of what he needs for his business and not what a specific methodology imposes.  
<br />
Waterfall in software development, where people tend to compare it to Agile, is a catastrophe or appears to be (we have no experience in it).  It is absolutely unflexible and aims at having a "Big Bang" huge delivery after months and months of work.  In software development, during those months, modifications, new features, and more change requests have risen, but can't be added to the project.  Now, if you take a bridge construction project or a new type of mobile to be manufactured, you probably wouldn't want to change anything once the project implementation has started.  Manufacturing and construction sectors are examples where this methodology can be effective.  It's a question of using it in the right context.  Which is exactly the case for all methodologies, they are adapted to certain types of projects, just like ours. Even though you could probably use our methodology to renovate your house, it would work, but it's a question of what is the best and not what works.

<tr>

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">Muda, getting rid of waste.  We have an Essential Plan, which is the minimum you need to run a successful project.  All extras have been eliminated to have the most efficient plan as possible. 
<br />
Muri, removing overload so nothing slows down.  We don't do the same thing twice, everything is processed, we clear away the obstacles to allow the team members to move forward, we eliminated uncessary steps and if in demand anyway, it is still available as an option.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;"><center>Prince2</center></td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
A more classic methodology to Project Management, lot's to learn from it.  We took many of the deliverables (documents) from this methodology.  Since they are the most popular ones, we wanted to offer what customers want and what customers want it what they are use to getting.  For example, the Communication Management Strategy, could you really do without?  We actually don't depend on it but it's part of the process.  Our methodology is based on communication, communication, communication, so we want to communicate with EVERYONE, keeping them all informed in the same way.  Now obviously this doesn't work for every customer, some are based on a very hierarchal structure and thus don't share between teams.  We can adapt.  In resume, we take a lot from Prince2 but not all of it is used by default.

We could keep going and look into PMP, Extreme Programming,... but in the end, it always comes down to taking the best and leaving the rest.	

<!-- **************** -->								

## Project Phases 

Our Methodology has 8 phases, and yes Sales is part of the Phases. Why? Because during that stage we are already gathering information about your project that will allow the Project Manager to manage your project. So the methodology starts there. If for some reason we didn't have a Sales phase in a project, then we would be missing valuable information. We aim to go above and beyond the usual basic Project Management offering, that is why there is a Idea Phase and you could probably add In
itate Phase to that. That being pre-launch project activities for which a Project Manager is not always solicitated. We will look later at some Rules and Guidelines, but one of the principale caractheristic of our methodology is to not ask more than once the same information. For example, the project Scope, you find this in almost all PM documents, so it's easy to write it over and over again. But we get this information during the Sales Phase, it gets processes into the system, has it's own place an
d can and will get used throught the project, it is easy accessible and always at the same place. As a customer you will have a few forms to fill depending on the Phase, but you will not find the same question twice. And the stored data is not immutable, it can be updated throughout the Project by various team members. In the end we all work together to achieve a common goal, a successful project.

 Let's go see the Idea Phase.  Here you have an idea or undefined goal like "should we move our e-commerce site from our traditionall hoster to a Cloud Service Provider?". "Or maybe we should only move the content management since we have hundred of thousands of pictures, videos and documents?" You are now faced with at least two possible projects. You can choose to do neither, or pick one of the two. To make sure he makes the right decision and more precisely has all the necessary information to take that decision, he needs to go throught a process of analysis of each potential project. We can walk you throught the Idea Phase, investigate, research, analyse each option. When working with us, once you make it to the end of the Phase, you know you will have taken the best decision for your business. It's not just a question of technology, you have to consider if your company is Cloud Ready, is the project is good for the business depending on it's current status and financial situation, does your team have time to work on a new project, will it fit in your current processes, ... and so on. Most project that fail didn't have a proper feasability analysis done.</td>

In this phase our customer already has his Idea. If all was prepared correctly, then a few documents already exists. Examples are New Project Proposal, Project Charter, Gap Analysis, or a Business Plan... Now we look at the project in more technical details, SOW, Deliverables,... And finally, we can manage for you the choice of suppliers, RFI/RFP and Contract negotiation. We bring you to the stage where you have all the elements in hand to either go with the project and just put things into motion in the next Phase, Assess or drop the project because it doesn't have all the requirements to be approved internally.

Now we get serious! This is often where your Project Manager starts, the two previous Phases are optional. Again, if things where done correctly there is some documentation available for the Project Manager to start his knowledge aquisition stage (he needs to understand the project). But don't worry, if nothing exists he knows how to figure it all out. There are a few deliverables in the Assess &amp; Plan Phases, many of which are optional. These Phases are the most important, the Project Manager must understand your project correctly to Plan adecately. This is why your involvement during the Assessment is so crucial.

This is by far a {Value Added Service}.  Project Managers are usually involved when a project hasn't been launched into production.  But the reality is once in production, a project is not necessarily ready to be handed over.  There is still a lot of work to be done.  During the project, the Project Manager was probably involved in preparing your business to manage this change, or at least should.  HR, provisioning, recruitment, support, change management and much more need assistance in this new Cloud Implementation which is usually not something they have done before.  To make the transition from project to production and assist during the first couple of months to make sure everything is in place, who better than the Project Manager who usually is the person with the most knowledge on the subject.  Example of tasks can be change management process, support documentation, incident escalation process, but he can do so much more.  His role is not to make the link between your business and you Cloud Provider, but to make your Cloud Infrastructure part of you business.

# The Indalit People

## What is A Great Project Manager?

One that gets things done and the customer is satisfied.

<!-- **************** -->

## What Is The Training/Background of the Project Managers?

Specific character traits are looked for during the recruitment process.  This takes the lead over studies and experience.  Some of us are born Project Managers and that is who we want.  Obviously Project Managers don't need to be Solution Architects but still need to best possible understanding of IT technologies and Cloud Services.  The engineers will provide the schedule as to how much time is required for a task, but this is often very much overestimated when it comes from suppliers and underestimated when in comes from your internal teams.  So the Project Manager needs to be able to judge if the estimations are accurate.

### Training

Intensive.  We have an extensive training path with various exams, accreditations and certifications.  Depending on the experience and knowledge of the recruit, the training start from a few weeks to a few months to get the accreditations and certifacations.

### Personal Study Path

In IT you need to learn all the time, and Project Managers are not exceptions to this.  We have put in place a system to allow for training, learning and teaching.  This is both an investment from Indalit and the Project Manager.  

### Accreditations and Certifications

Many, many...  We obviously can't to them all.  Based on knowledge and experience we will adapt the requirements to each Project Manager.  The aim is to have at least one per Cloud Provider we support.

### Technical Discovery

Learn, learn, learn, but how?  For non technical staff it's not always easy to take on a new technology or service and figure it out.  We have build a {Technical Discovery Process} which guides our Project Managers through this learning process.  Just read and search the internet, follow the steps, answer the questions and in the end they will have acquired a new skill.

## How Can We Go Beyond Project Management?

We want to be your ally from the start, someone you can count on on getting anything you need done.  In the end, it's just a question of time.
