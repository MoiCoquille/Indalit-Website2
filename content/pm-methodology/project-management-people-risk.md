There is so much talk about around Project <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#risk">Risks</a> & Project <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#issue">Issues</a> management that we often forget the most important of them all, <b>PEOPLE</b>.  Before creating your usual Project <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#rilog">Risks & Issues Log</a>, consider how to deal with the biggest <i>Issue</i> of them all.

As Project Managers, <i>Risks</i> & <i>Issues</i> are what we manage daily, it's our role to identify these and plan around them.  As an example, for some reason we never really add in our <i>Risks</i> & <i>Issues</i> Log the fact that the people don't read their emails, they skim through them. This probably has a bigger incidence on the failure of a project than would a late delivery.  To deal with the <b>People Risks</b>, you need to identify them, know how to recognize them, and mostly know <b>how to minimize their negative effects</b> on your project.  Don't forget, <b>you can't change people</b> you can only guide them in the right direction.

Now let's identify them and see what actions you can take to counter them.  Once you accept these, you can handle them.  We don't live in the wonderful world of the <b><i>Care Bares</i></b>.  These are not applicable to everyone, but still apply to many.

	<li><span style="color:grey"><b>Let them know they are late</b> and ask them not to be next time, obviously in a diplomatic manner.</li>
</ul>
People are not use to being told when they have a bad behavior, you will be surprised to see that when it happens, they usually listen and take it into account when it's not said in an aggressive or an accusatory manner.

    But, and there is a big BUT, in the process.  If you can't get this person to do their work because they think they are above it, then <b>escalate</b>.

This is a big one.  As Project Managers you know to communicate intensively, but in the end, all the documentations written and the emails and the meeting minutes are generally ignored or read diagonally.  This means you can't assume the people know something.  Ok, it's their responsibility if they don't take the time to read properly, but in the end, the success of the project is your unique goal.

If you critic, then propose a solution or better, ask the other person to propose a solution.  
Point out the consequences of what they are doing wrong instead of pointing at them.  If they feel attacked, they will close up and not listen to anything.

Lack of time, knowledge, guidance ends up in incompetence.  Needing help is not well regarded, so people tend to keep quite when they can't do something.
Give them a chance.
If they're incompetent and don't care, then escalate.

This gets worse if you play the game and do it for them.  <b>You must guide them</b>, but not take on the responsibility of finding the information yourself.

This is a tough one, you need a masters degree in psychology to manage this.  Your goal is for them to accept the change.  You can try the following:
<ul style="color:#d84315">
	<li><span style="color:grey">Show them what they gain from changing, what others gain and what the company gains.</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">Give the steps to making the change if they are small.</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey"><b>Sell the change</b> through a presentation, a call or an email.  In reality a <i>Project Manager</i> is also a Sales Representative.</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">Make it into something WOW, amazing.  Be enthusiastic.</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">If it's a general movement, then explain how people are moving over to this and that they need to follow it even if they don't agree.</li>

In todays business world, people tend to be very busy.  Learning means either not working during the time you are learning or doing it on your own time after work.  Now we may know that learning is a personal development and not the responsibility of our employer, but still, we expect it to be easy.  In the end, you can't learn it for them.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Be ready to be surprised.  As a Project Manager you see all the problems, <i>Risks</i>, <i>Issues</i>, delays, ...  But in the end your projects are all a success when prepared correctly.  No matter how bad people may appear to be individually, as a group they can surpass themselves.  Macro view, not micro.  If you look at a person from 5 meters away, they can be beautiful, if you look at them 5 cm away, then there not so beautiful.
