There is so much talk around Project <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#risk">Risks</a> & Project <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#issue">Issues</a> management that we often forget the most important of them all, PEOPLE.  

You can plan around an electrical failure, have a backup plan, secondary provider and so on.  But people are the center of it all.  They make the difference between a project that fails and one that is a success.  So before creating your usual project Project <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#rilog">Risks & Issues Log</a>, consider how to deal with the biggest Issue of them all.

As Project Managers, Risks & Issues are what we manage daily, it's our role to identify these and plan around them.  As an example, for some reason we never really add in our Risks & Issues Log the fact that the people don't read their emails, they skim through it. Even when considering this probably has a bigger incidence on the failure of a project than would a late delivery.  To deal with the People Risks, you need to identify them, know how to notice them in people, and mostly know how to minimize the negative effects they can have on your project.  Don't forget, you won't change people you can only guide them in the right direction.

Now let's identify them and then see what actions to take to counter People Risks and Issues.  Once you accept these, you can handle them.  We don't live in the wonderfull world of the <i>Care Bares</i>.  These are not applicable to everyone, but still apply to many.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People are late.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Start without them.  Let them know they are late and ask them not to be next time, obviously in a deplomatic manner.  People are not use to being told when they have a bad behaviour, you will be surprised to see that when it happens, they usually listen and take it into account when it's not said in an aggressive or an accusatory manner.
</td>

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People consider themselves very busy.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Break down the tasks into smaller tasks.  If they receive a question, then you have a chance they might answer it right away, but if the receive a questionnaire, then for sure they will put it aside for later.
</td>

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People think they are smartest.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Let them think that, no point in breaking there bubble and anyway, they wouldn't be receptive to it not being true.  This is where your political abilities come into play and use the use of flatery if necessary.  In the end, you need something from them and you need to find the way to get it.  But, and there is a big BUT, in the process don't diminish yourself.  If you can't get this person to do their work because they think they are above it, then escalate.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People don't listen.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Repeat, repeat, repeat, write, email, call, repeat.  Don't assume because you said it once during a <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#kickoff">Kickoff Meeting</a> that they will still remember two months down the line.  
</td>

<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People don't read.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
This is a big one.  As Project Managers you know to communicate intensivily, but in the end, all the documentations written and the emails and the meeting minutes are generally ignored or read diagonaly.  This means you can't assume the people know something.  Ok, it's their responsibility if they don't take the time to read properly, but in the end, the success of the project is your unique goal.  
Be concise, highlight the important parts, provide a quick extract of the main points, do what you need to make sure they read the things you want them to.
Assigning responsibility can be a good option.  
Another is requesting feedback or asking a question about what was to be read.

People have a short attention span.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Get them at the start of the day.
Break down whatever you need into smaller digestible chunks.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People don't accept critics.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Say it nicely, no need to copy everyone on it.  Even better call, don't write it, less aggressive this way.  You can always follow-up with an email to review what was said. 
If you critic, then propose a solution or better, ask the other person to propose a solution.  
Point out the consequences of what they are doing wrong instead of pointing at them.  If they feel attacked, they will close up and not listen to anything.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People are too often incompetent.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Lack of time, knowledge, guidance ends up in incompetence.  Needing help is not well regarded, so people tend to keep quite when they can't do something.
Make it clear over and over that they can come to you for anything.  If you don't have the answer, you will point them in the right direction.
Once they've done something poorly, work with them to see how it can be fixed.  Give them a chance.
If they're incompetent and don't care, then escalate.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People are too lazy to look for themselves.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
This gets worse if you play the game and do it for them.  You must guide them, not take on the responsibility of finding the information yourself.
Give them hints, but never do it for them.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People don't want to change.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
This is a tough one, you need a masters degree in psychology to manage this.
The goal is to have them accept the change.  To do so, you need to show them what they gain from changing, what others gain and what the company gains.  If it's a general movement, then explain how people are moving over to this.  Give the steps to making the change if they are small.  In the end, if the trend is to change in that way, then they will not have a choice and resisting will make it worse on them.
Another method would be to sell the change through a presentation, a call or an email.  Make it into something WOW.  Explain with enthusiasme how amazing it is.  In the end, Project Manager is also a Sales job.

People will say bad things about others.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
In most cases ignore, it is simply human nature.  You are probably doing the same.
But when it has degenerated into a conflict then you need to go throught the <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#conflictresolution">Conflict Resolution Process</a>.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People expect respect, consideration and sometimes devotion.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Give them the respect you deserve.  
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People don't understand what you want.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Explain again dividing into many points.  Go through them one by one and only move on to the next point when the current one is understood.  Break it down, this fixes a lot of things.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
People always choose the easy way.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Try making the easy way your way.  In the end, you want something, then it is your responsibility to do what is necessary to get what you want.  If you need to spend more time preparing a form or something, then go ahead.  Make it easy.

People don't take the time to learn.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
In todays business world, people tend to be very busy.  Learning means either not working during the time you are learning or doing it on your own time after work.  Now we may know that learning is a personal development and not the responsibility of our employer, but still, we expect it to be easy.  In the end, you can't learn it for them.  
For the small things, break down your instructions or information into small chunks and put them as bullet points.  Make it easy.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 30%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
And then people do something amazing!  They are human.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Be ready to be surprised.  As a Project Manager you see all the problems, risks, issues, delays, ...  But in the end your projects are all a success.  No matter how bad people may appear to be individually, as a group they can surpass themselves.  Macro view, not micro.  If you look at a person from 5 meters away, they can be beautiful, if you look at them 5 cm away, then there not so beautiful.
