As you probably don't know, I am creating/making/writing/configuring <a href="http://www.indalit.com">www.indalit.com</a> using an open source static site generator called <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>.  I've chosen a theme and moved forward from that.  The small glitch is I'm am NOT a web developer at all.  I've learned Python for fun and mostly forgot since I haven't been  practicing, but that's all my experience in the development world.  So working on this site has been a great challenge for me; Hugo provides a theme, but that's just the base and after that you have a lot of modifications to do.  So when it came time to do the Packs page, <a href="http://www.indalit.com/packs/">www.indalit.com/packs/</a>, I was a bit worried what was it going to look like.  There was no pre-done formatting from the theme I could use, so I had a blank page.  There were two options, go for designing it into an image or do it manually.  The first option was just impossible, I simply can't create an image from scratch like a web designer or graphic designer would do, I can only modify one.  Then let's go for the second option.  Keep in mind I am not a web designer, have an open mind in your judgement, but I managed to put together the following:

It looks like nothing, but required some html and css work I had never done before. Divs, borders, alignment,... Ok, ok, the actual formatting of my html file is embarrassing, but it works for me.  I've got enough overhead having to use git all the time.  No I'm not a developer at heart.

For now, I'm going to move on to writing content for the site.  Lots of pages to do.
