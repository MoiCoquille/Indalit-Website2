### Ugliness

After working on the website for over a week, maybe even two, I can't help but find it just doesn't have the right look.  I've redone the packs page/pages a few times and I'm still not happy with them.  I know I will have to continue working on them tomorrow.  The homepage template is great, perfectly corporate, but the images in the carousel and the formatting of the text just don't cut it.  In the end, what is wrong is the pages I did some work on.  Good thing this is not my real job!

### Industrialized Versus Homemade Cakes

We are use to what is industrialized, including websites.  They are well designed and definitely pleasing to the eye.  When it comes to the taste, that is a whole other story.  They use the cheapest ingredients they can find and put no effort in making a quality cake, just needs to look good, people will buy it.  One the other hand a homemade cake looks generally not so good.  We don't have the machines to make it perfect, nor the technique.  But, I usually taste great, much better than the beautiful store bought.  Unfortunately, the reality is people will prefer to buy crap that looks good.  So what does this mean for us?

### Industrialized Versus Homemade Websites

Our website is homemade, just doesn't have that industrialized look.  Even though a lot of effort was put into it, we are not web designer or graphic designers.  On the other hand the taste, i.e. the content, is much better, the organization simple and easy to understand, no bullshit words and phrases, you can clearly see what we do and what products we offer, we provide a blog with a lot of real content...  But people choose what looks best, I probably do the same.

### The Truth

The truth is I would prefer one of those prefab websites that look great, but we chose another route.  Why make it easy when it can be so hard.  It may be harder, but I must admit it's more fun.  But our customer acquisition will be done over the net via our website :-(  So even if potential customers make it to our site, we will loose some just because we don't look great.  

### A Small Burst of Energy?

But in the end, I want this company to be human, a place where people want to work, a place where there is room for creativity and initiative.  It's like these blog entries I write, they are far from being "professional", but I enjoy writing them so I do it.  

Feeling discouraged today.
