### Where I'm at

At this stage, I've done things in a total crazy order.  I've followed what I feel like doing instead of doing it all in the right order.  Doesn't really matter, all things are moving forward, there might be some wasted time but at least I'm doing what I enjoy.  Until...

### Veronique the Accountant

This business is divided into two parts.  The first one is this project, so you already have an idea what it's about.  The second is my associates project, and it has nothing to do with mine.  But his part is ready to go and he has a customer, so I need to put aside my project for now and work on having the basics setup, i.e. accounting.  So, I decided to go with an ERP, why not.  Might as well do it correctly from the beginning.  It has a CRM which I think is mandatory and does the accounting and much more.  So, I was an IT engineer for a bit, while I installed a VM, my ERP software, a web server, a database and a few extras.  Now it's ready to go.  Up to now, it's been quite simple, but today I decided I would setup the accounting part.  As a newbie, I expected this to be as easy as the rest of the setup in my ERP.  And then I followed the instructions, went to a page called the chart of accounts and needed to pick one for my services.  Sounds easy?  Well, there is almost 800 of them and all in Spanish!!!

### Surrender

Ok, I had to accept the fact that I am not going to be able to wing this one.  So I find a course on YouTube and start.  It's a complete university course, should cover everything I need to know.  To start off, you need a book, already there you've pretty much lost me, I need to start now, not in a couple days when I receive the book.  But I make the effort and check it out, almost 300â‚¬, you definitely lost me there.  So I decide I need something more compact, aimed at small startup businesses.  I've found it, started and watch at least 2 minutes before I came here to write on this blog my frustration.  This is going to take me a while and on top of it it's really NOT interesting.  So I am mentally preparing myself for a couple days of boredom.  In the end I will get it done and I will be proud of myself but now I would rather go take a nap!  Wish I had studied this when I was younger.  I think this is an important subject that many people will face in life and should be mandatory, at least some introduction to it.  But no, it was better to learn how to play the flute or even abstract mathematics or physics things that you never remember after 1 week and that are absolutely useless in life unless you go into that field.

### Moving Forward

So off I go to my Youtube class to become a newbie accountant.  The truth is I already have someone who does the accounting, but I can't imagine having absolutely no control over it, so I need to understand it and have my own books.  If he tries to ripe me off at least I can see it coming and hopefully prevent it.

### What Else

Well, lots of things have happened since my last post.  I went on a forced vacation, but I spent most of my time working, simply because that was what I wanted to be doing.  I found 3 interns to come a work for me for a couple of months.  I have a crazy list of things for them to do, I think very interesting for a student.  Anyway, the first one starts on the 9th of April, can't wait.  Hope they are going to be as good as they sound.  You know about my ERP, so I now have one of those.  I might have a sales person who can participate in the project.  It's to early to say, still just an idea, but who knows.  I think you all know I wish I wasn't alone on this.  I also may be working with someone on a specific set of services I hadn't planned on selling, at least not at this stage.  Still to early to say anything, but who knows.  And I have my mentor who tries to keep me on track doing things in a certain order, it must be exasperating for her to see me move forward the way I am.  But I was never one to do things like everyone else, I seem to always pick the most difficult route, for some reason I just don't fit in any mold.  But I've had a successful career until I put an end to it, so I must be doing something right.

### How do I feel?

I play with the numbers regularly, analyze if I sold this  more or this less what would happen, or play with the leads or...  This generates two states: first one, I'm ecstatic, I'm going to have 50 employees and be rich and the second one where I fail completely and have to shut down.  Yesterday was the second, so I went to bed discouraged.  I played a little this morning and it's a bit better.  So I feel fine, still motivated.  But I don't feel great about it.  It's a so so feeling.  But the reality is a am a pessimist, so maybe my numbers are a bit low.  We will see, I still need more information to validate the numbers I've chosen, not all are based on something concrete.
