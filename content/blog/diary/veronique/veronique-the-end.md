I'm continuing to be a web developer, graphic designer and writer.  I'm definitely better at HTML and CSS, but not the design and content part.  So I've decided to accept the not so perfect pages, they may not look top notch professional but they will do the job.  In the end, what will matter is the service we give and not the design of our web site.  As for content, I guess "INTERNET" will need to deal with the more direct approach and finally give up on all the bullshit keywords and phrases.  I've been in IT more than 20 years and I still don't understand many of them.  In the end, I'm never happy with myself anyway, so I need to move on, I've been on this long enough.  I must say it was fun, now it's just the frequent content to add and work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" target="_blank">SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</a>.

Here are the pages I designed that are not part of the original template:

* <a href="/packs/">Packaged Services Offered</a>
* <a href="/aws-amazon-web-services-consultants/">More details on AWS and Indalit</a> 
* <a href="/devops-consultants/">More details on DevOps and Indalit</a>
* <a href="/blog/2018/02/21/aws-aurora-multi-master/">An example BLOG entry for the "Did You Know?" series</a>

I've ignored the title but I guess I have to elaborate a bit.  Why can't I imagine the goal?  Well, there is just to much to do and learn before we can consider opening.  At this pace I don't see how we can open at all.  Then there is the "it won't work" which is the hardest one to deal with.  For the first, you need to look at your feet, not even think about the goal.  Enjoy the preparation stage, take it little step by little step and pretend the goal doesn't exist.  “It won't work” is tough.  You think about all the work your putting in for nothing.  Why would customers come our way? (probably the <a href="/packs/">Packaged Services Offered</a>, at this stage they are really cheap!)  Can we actually offer what we say we can?  How the hell are we going to find customers?  What if it's a complete fail?... and it goes on.  For this, ignore.  Again, take pleasure in what your doing now.  Now, you walk little steps, looking at your feet, telling yourself your having a great time doing things without a goal, and ignore the doubts of achievement.  Just watch out where your going, you don't want to hit a wall or get lost along the way.  So sometimes you need to sit down, get your courage and look at the goal, check if your on the right path, does it need to be adjusted, visualize your success and trust life will give you what you want after all the bad things you've been through, and I've had a particularly difficult last 5 or 6 years.  My 2$ worth of advice!

I tend to do everything on my own with little help from anyone, but maybe a coach/motivator would be a good thing to keep me going?  I don't know.  I also realize we choose the difficult route.  We could have found investors and started exactly like we want the company to be.  Instead, we choose the long difficult road which may take us years to reach that goal.  In the meantime I will have to do things I'm not necessarily good at and I don't like, things like sales.  I'm way to direct and to the point to be a good sales person.  I am an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/" target="_blank">AWS Certified Solutions Architect</a> since July.  But I don't have time to improve my knowledge on AWS services, write <a href="https://medium.com/@VeroniqueR/understanding-aws-elastic-load-balancing-62bf3d2cec5f" target="_blank">AWS articles</a> like I had planned, create <a href="https://github.com/MoiCoquille/AWS_Cheat-Sheets" target="_blank">My AWS Cheat Sheets </a>, build a training documentation on each AWS service, keep sending my <a href="https://twitter.com/indalitcloud" target="_blank">Did You Know?</a> series and finally, also learn other stuff.  Pffff, how can one not drown in all of this?  It's a good thing we are offering services that will become more and more in demand in the years to come which is not in a saturated market.

If you have any suggestions as to how to deal with the stress of opening a new business, feel free to sent me a mail <a href="mailto:v@indalit.com">v@indalit.com</a>.  I decided not to turn on comments on the blog, too many "haters" out there who can't help being nasty.  I don't have the time to moderate the comments.

This week I should be able to work on other tasks, that is if I don't try and pass the website into multiple languages, but that's going to be crazy work, so I'm not sure to start now.  Contracts need to be worked on, templates like bills and quotes..., sales documentation, presentations, looking for an internship, SEO, SEM, ...  OK, look at my feet, look at my feet!  I also got myself involved in creating a website for a real estate agency, so I need to finish that project.  

All in all, this is still fun.  I’m up at maximum 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 and work till at least 10, very motivated.
