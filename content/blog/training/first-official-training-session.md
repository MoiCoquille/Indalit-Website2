We are doing like  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/" target="_blank">AWS</a>.  In 2003, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">www.amazon.com</a> leaders where asked what are the core strengths of the company.  They realized it was their IT infrastructure services.  From there grew the idea, what if we sold also our technical competences?  In 2006 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon S3</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2</a> where launched and now they dominate the Public Cloud Market.  We are no where near <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a> today but we learn from them a great lesson.  Even if you are selling "External Service A" which works on "Internal Service B" you can sell B since it's a great service.  Hope that makes sense.  In the end, we have a great IT Training Program, Novice to IT Professional and we intend on offering it as a "External Service".  In the end, we win, if our customers are IT trained, then managing their projects will be much easier.

Monday July 23rd, 2018 was the first official Training Course.  We had an amazing turnout of 1 student.  May not seem like much, but this student was very motivated and greatly participated making the course material even better.  

We are in our Beta stage so we offer the IT courses for free while we enhance and make them the best possible.  The goal is to take a normal IT home user with skills around browsing, PC, various user applications like a word processor, someone who uses emails, the Internet to search for various information ... and turn them into IT professionals for jobs like Service Manager, Service Delivery Manager, Project Manager, Manager, CXO and more ...  No one needs to feel out of the loop in technical meetings anymore!
