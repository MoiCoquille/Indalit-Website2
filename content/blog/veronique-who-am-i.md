Yes, it's official, we are starting the process of creating our company.  I assume this will take a few months, but I am not in a hurry.  Roles are not clear for now, so I go with the flow.  At this point I seem responsible for the creating of the website and it's content.  So, I decided on having a blog.  Inicially thinking it will look professional, be a good place to publish what I write about AWS and help with SEO.  But then, why not have a bit of fun and have a personal part on the blog to actually share the steps in creating a company.  I want to provide a "human" look and feel for my company, so why not.  This means I will not pretent we are a multi-national with offices all over the world and 150 employees.  No, for now we are starting, we will grow considerably, but let's stay humble at first, it's just us. 

So then who am I?  You can look at my LinkedIn profile if that is how you judge a person, [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veroniqueheitor/).  I'm a bit out of the norme, have always run forward fast, always changing and progressing fast, hard to follow.  But then, I decided to put a stop to it all for a few years.  Now, I hate myself for all that study time I could have had but didn't.  I'm always learning new things now, but seems I can't learn enough, fast enough.  But you can't go back.  

Someone presented AWS to me at least a year ago and it just blew my mind, the posibilities!  Since them, I've been concentrating my energie on AWS and have decided this is the direction I want to take.  I need to show others why I think AWS is so great.  So I passed the Solutions Architect Certification and now I am opening an AWS consulting company.  

A quick overview?  I'm a tecky, a bit nerdy, opening a business and doing a bunch of different jobs.  I'm an AWS Solutions Architect, a web developer, SEO expert, sales representative, project manager, financial director, lawyer, and marketing.  Oh and human resources and secretary.  With all these hats, I should be busy for a while.

This was a quick overview, it takes time to get to know anyone.  So now lets see where this adventure takes us.
