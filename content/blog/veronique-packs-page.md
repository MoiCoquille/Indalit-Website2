As you probably don't know, I am creating/making/writing/configuring <a href="http://www.indalit.com">www.indalit.com</a> using an open-source static site generators called <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>.  I've chosen a theme and moved forward from that.  The small glitch is I'm am NOT a web developerat all.  I've learned Python for fun and mostly forgot since I didn't practice, but that's all my experience in the development work.  So working on this site has been a challenge.  So when it came time to do the Packs page, I was a bit worried.  There was no predone formating from the theme I could use, so I had a blank page.  There was two options, go for designing it into an image or do it manually.  The first option was just impossible, I simply can't create an image from scratch like a web designer or graphic designer would do, I can only modify one.  Then let's go for the second option.  Keep in mind I am not a web designer, have an open mind in your judgement, but I managed to put together the following:

It looks like nothing, but required some html and css work I had never done before. Divs, borders, alignment,... Ok, ok, the actual formating of my html file is embarrassing, but it works for me.  I've got enough overhead having to use git all the time.  No I'm not a developer at heart.
