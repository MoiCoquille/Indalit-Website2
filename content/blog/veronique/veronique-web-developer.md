It’s time for another update.  I’m still a web developer for now, it’s taking much more time than planned.  The good news is yesterday I sat down and started to write HTML with nested DIVS and formatting all over the place without any hesitation, just came out like I’ve been doing it for some time.  I know this won’t last, when I’m done, it will go away as fast as it came, but I’m proud of myself.

So where are we with the website?  Not doing well yet.  A new bug has appeared without notice, the carousel now shows all sliding pages at once, so no more carousel, just one big blob.  And obviously it doesn’t do it on my development environment or on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">AWS S3</a>, it just does it on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank">AWS CloudFront</a>.  Yes we went with state of the art hosting.

In a previous post you might have noticed how proud I was of my “packs” page.  I decided yesterday it was simply ugly.  I did mention I wasn’t a web designer, and I proved it.  Now I investigated first, got ideas and found the look I wanted.  I’m at the fun part now, coding it.  And this time I’m going to do a better job of it.

Managed to get some legal work, graphical design and HR work done.  I’ve decided to take some internships and get things moving.  Seems like just 6 months ago I was wasting my time and now, I’m running out of it.  I’ve got a 2 week vacation coming up and that just doesn’t fit into my schedule, but I have no choice.  I’ll try and get some work done anyway, I’ll let the others go skiing.

Got some good ideas for our initial recruitment strategy which will affect positively how much we will charge, the lower the better.  This will make us competitive, make us an obvious choice knowing that working with us will be the best solution.  Feeling positive, this will work.  It’s important to listen to others, they have a different point of view and can open up opportunities you hadn’t even thought about.

I’m having fun now.
