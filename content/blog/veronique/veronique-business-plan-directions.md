### My Business Plan

Like any serious future business owner, one does a business plan.  This may seem like a small thing, but it's a crazy document to complete, which makes you write a bunch of other documents/excel sheets.  You also need to do a market research which I honestly have been ignoring.  But if you do all that correctly, then your business is sure to thrive.  Once you have finished the business plan, all you need to do is push "PLAY" and it all happens because everything is ready to go.  So while I was blissfully ignoring the market research and going straight to the business plan, I hit a section on "Distribution Channels".  At first I had the usual you would see for a consulting company, Internet, Direct Sales,...  but then I had two ideas.  One of them will bring business fast, but will take out all the pleasure and I become a meat reseller, nothing more.  I want my own successes, I want a great team, I want to have fun.  The other one is a great idea if it actually works.  It's still going to require some sells on my part, but I knew I was going to have to go down that route anyway.  This could be my single source of leads.  Sorry if I'm not giving more information about these two ideas, but at this stage it's TOP SECRET.  

The rest of this post has been censured, I wrote too much, unveiling to much about my plans.  So from here on is new content.  And don't worry, what I had written wasn't particularly interesting anyway.

### A Mentor

To help me on my journey, I decided I needed a mentor.  Someone with experience in opening a business or businesses, somebody I can annoy with all the things I always want to talk about (because I'm obsessed by this), somebody who I know has good advice so I can actually listen to them,...  So I found one.  I explained the project, the ideas and the status and didn't hear what I was hoping to hear.  She pointed out the weaknesses in my ideas, what I need to work on first, what isn't a good idea, ...  She thinks the project is great, but still immature, which I agree with.  But for example, the main differentiation I was going to have with my competitors is the price, and she thinks that's not a good idea.  Bubble burster right there.  This was the only element on which I was hoping to have some control over.

### Vacation

So I am writing this from Risoul, a ski resort in France.  I must admit this vacation has kind of been forced on me.  I have so much to do for Indalit, feels like I'm wasting my time.  But until now, I only ski 2 - 3 hours and then I come back to the apartment and get on with work.

### Internship

I've decided to open up internships.  I have a lot of things to do and I think some of it can be done by interns as long as they can grasp what we do, who is AWS and what is a Public Cloud.  The search is not easy, trying best I can to make the internship look sexy, but a couple things are of no interest to interns.  In the end, like the rest, try and move forward.  I'm hoping to find two which would start next month.  I might not be a glamorous offering, but I have real work for them to do, a real work experience.  No assistant to the assistant tasks.  I've done a couple of interviews since I'm on vacation and still more to come.

### What's next?

Business plan, business plan, business plan oh and market research.  I want to finish it within two weeks, should be plenty of time.  The problem I encountered is while I was writing it out, I was learning new things and having new ideas.  So right now it's not coherent and for now I have 67 pages to go over and rewrite bits and pieces.  I'm glad I'm doing it.  Had someone I know tell me it was a waste of time.  Coming from him it reassured me in the importance of doing it.  He started a company without one, the pricing strategy was all wrong and he makes very little money.  A business plan would have probably showed him this problem.  At this stage I have a much clearer vision of what I am going to do and how I am going to do it.  I just have so many things to prepare first, feels like I'm never going to finish.

### Two

We are two founders, but the other one is working full-time on another project.  This project would have required two people, so I have to accept that everything is going to take a little bit more time.  I could have tried to find someone, but the reality is at this stage I'm not willing to share and I'm not willing to constantly make compromises.  It's just that I've been through a very difficult patch in the last couple of years which has had a huge impact on me.  For example, if I'd done this 4 years ago, I wouldn't have wanted a mentor.

How do I feel?  I have better vision of what this company will be, but I still have doubts on its success.  I feel a bit discouraged and a bit overwhelmed.  But I'm still moving forward.
