Yes, it's official, we are starting the process of creating our company.  I assume this will take a few months, but I am not in a hurry.  At this stage roles are not clear, so I go with the flow.  For now, I seem responsible for the design/creation and configuration of our website [Indalit.com](http://www.indalit.com) and it's content.  So, I decided on having a blog.  Inicially thinking it will look professional, be a good place to publish what I write about AWS and help with SEO.  But then, why not have a bit of fun and have a personal part on the blog to actually share the steps in creating a company.  Maybe it's ambitious of me, but I want a "human" company where employees want to stay because they can't find the same.  This means I will not pretent we are a multi-national with offices all over the world and 150 employees in each.  Our front window, the website, will not contain phrases that sound good but mean nothing.  This may be a mistake, but the least I can do it try.  So my posts on the blog are part of this initiative. 

So then who am I?  You can look at my LinkedIn profile, it gives you a view of who I am professionally, [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veroniqueheitor/).  I'm a bit out of the norme, have always run forward fast, always changing and progressing fast, hard to follow.  It's been a crazy ride since I started IT so at some point I decided to put a stop to it all for a few years.  I tried other things, but nothing I was passionate about.  Now, I hate myself for all that study time I could have had but didn't.  I'm always learning new things now, but seems I can't learn enough, fast enough.  But you can't go back and change the past.

Why AWS, [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)?  Someone presented AWS to me at least two years ago and it just blew my mind, the posibilities!  Since then, I've been concentrating my energie on AWS and have decided this is the direction I want to take.  I need to show others why AWS is the direction to take.  To do this I passed the Solutions Architect Certification and since have been writing [articles](https://medium.com/search?q=Understanding%20AWS%20Elastic%20Load%20Balancing), [posts](/blog/2017/07/28/aws-ec2-ebs-encryption/) and [Cheat Sheets](/blog/2017/12/14/aws-storage-gateway-cheatsheet/).
