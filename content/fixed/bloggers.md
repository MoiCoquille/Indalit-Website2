I always have a lot to write about, it's just a question of time.  I tend to write about anything, no specific subjects even though I try and stay in the <b>Project Management</b>, <b>IT Technologies</b> and <b>Cloud Services</b> universe.  Yes this is a professional BLOG, but there is no reason one can't enjoy himself.  We are a human company and thus do human things.  
<br />
<br />
My entry point for the <i>Public Cloud</i> world was <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS Services</a>.  Definitely fell in love with what they do and how they do it (except pricing).  So after learning Python (for no particular reason), I went for the <i>AWS Solutions Architect Certification</i>.  I will probably go for other Cloud Providers, like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, certifications, but first let me build my business.
<br />
<br />
Don't be surprised if something is a bit "off", I see things differently, it's all about <b>organization</b>, <b>logic</b> and <b>efficiency</b>.  If you have anything special you want me to write about, or questions let me know at <a href="mailto:v@indalit.com">v@indalit.com</a>
