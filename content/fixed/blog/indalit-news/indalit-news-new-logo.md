We have a new logo.  It's actually just an update, but it's still a new logo.

While we are on the subjet, let us explain the meaning of our logo.  It actually comes from something and wasn't just created from nothing, it has a meaning.  And yes, the cloud is part of the source and has not been added to match the services we offer.  Wikipedia will explain it better than I will, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indalo" target="_blank">Indalo story on Wikipedia</a>.

You might have noticed that Indalit and Indalo are quite close, not a coincidence.
