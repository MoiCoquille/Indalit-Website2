## What Are Custom Options?

<i>Custom Options</i> are <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#deliverable">Deliverables</a> and/or <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#task">Tasks</a> that exists in the <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">Plans</a>.  You have more than hundred <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#step">Steps</a> in all the <a href="/project-management-methodology/"></a>a> + extra ones that are not part of any <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#phase">Phases</a>.  Many of the <i>Steps</i> are either a <i>Deliverable</i> or a <i>Task</i>.  For example, you may want to have a <a href="/pm-methodology/project-management-glossary/#projectplan">Project Plan</a> done but nothing else.  It's common for customers to take a <i>Plan</i> and add <i>Custom Options</i> to it to build their own Project Management Services.
