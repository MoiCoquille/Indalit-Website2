## A Bit About Our Mindset
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
We could write all the industry buzzwords, the usual chatter that actually conveys nothing about who you are and what to do as a company. You brows certain sites and just can't find what they offer exactly.  Maybe to more Business oriented roles these sites mean something to them.  At Indalit we have chosen to take a different approach.  As Project Managers we are particuarly good at organizing, giving clear messages and most importantly communicating.  Can you imagine Project Managers running your project without being clear on anything, communicating very little and disorganized?  We prone transparency in our way of managing your projects, so it is natural that we would do it all the way on our <a href="https://www.indalit.com" target="_blank">Website</a>, our <a href="https://twitter.com/indalitcloud" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/indalit-cloud-consulting" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and our <a href="/blog/">BLOG</a>.  We will give you the foundations of our services, so you can make a educated decision.  Others would say, give very little information so they have to call and get caught in the sales process.  We think efficiency first, why waste time if what your looking for is not what we offer.

## Why Our Own Project Management Methododoly? 

Because we offer new types of <a href="/project-management-services/all-project-management-services/">Services</a>, a {pay per hour model}, with defined Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">PLANS</a> to choose from and even the option to pick and build your own Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a> deliverables.  You will find in our {Project Management Methodology} lots or {rules} and {guidelines}, but none of them about actually doing a good {Project Plan} or other typical Project Management {Tasks}. Here is why. Project Management is our job and we do it well. It may sound pretentious, but in the end it's actually pretty easy. We consider this work to be something we cannot do wrong. How many times have you been to the dentist and he couldn't clean your teeth correctly? Personnaly, never happened. Obviously he knows how to do the basics of his role, and so do we. But, you've probably been to see dentists that you didn't like and didn't return. Now that is what counts. The base is easy, doing a good job is easy, but doing a great job takes effort, and that is what we aim for. That is what is special about our {Project Management Methodology}, it's built for greatness, good is no enough. With it, what we want is the following:


<ul style="color:#d84315">
	<li><span style="color:grey">Be great Project Managers (QUALITY)</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">Customers come back (CUSTOMER SATISFACTION)</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">Projects are a Success (PERFORMANCE)</li>
</ul>

<!-- **************** -->

## Our <a href="/project-management-services/all-project-management-services/">Services</a>

### Quality, Not Low Cost

Even though we are a more economical solution, we are not a low cost.  Your cost will always be lower if need less hours compared to a full-time Project Manager.  And if you do need a full-time Project Manager, we have very competetive prices compared to a full-time {freelance} Project Manager.  Obviously if you compare to a full-time employee, we are not the best alternative.  We have degressive pricing, the more hours a week you take and the more weeks you need, then the lower the cost.  But our {business model} is to provide quality work and be recognized for it.

### Our Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">PLANS</a> 

For our Project Management Methodology to be great AND adapted to Cloud Services and more specifically <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS Services</a>, it had to be homemade. All methodologies that exist have their advantages and disadvantages. None are specifically made for Cloud Services. So we took the best out of Agile, Scrum, Lean, Prince2,... and left the bad. We also need something adaptable for a more "efficient"offering for customers with limited budgets. Now we offer four different Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">PLANS</a>:


<center><img src="/img/pm-methodology/indalit-pm-plans.png" alt="A Project Manager giving you the option between plans with cookies, pie and cake" height="300" /></center>


We also have a forth possibility which is not a Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">PLANS</a> per say, but an option to pick and choose what PM tasks you want to be done.  This is the Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a>, let's call it a Plan just for the sake of it.  With these four Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">PLANS</a>, it is impossible for our customers to not get what they want. There is the minimum, <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/#essential">Essential Plan</a>, which offers what is necessary to have a successful project. If your looking for a SWOT Analysis for example, you're going to have to move up in the Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">PLANS</a>. The important thing is you have the option for limited budget. The <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/#prime">Prime Plan</a> and <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/#integral">Integral Plan</a> obviously offer each a little more then the one before.  And the last, Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a>, you get to pick and choose what you want, with the <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/#essential">Essential Plan</a> as bare minimum (our Project Managers need some mandatory tasks to do their job correctly, like having a Project Plan). What is interesting to know is that you don't necessarily pay more for a <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/#prime">Prime Plan</a> than an <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/#essential">Essential Plan</a>. Let me explain. If you have a project with 50 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2</a> Instances and 6 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">Amazon RDS</a> databases with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">AWS S3</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon CloudFront</a>, but you take the <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/#essential">Essential Plan</a>, you will pay more than a <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/#prime">Prime Plan</a> with 8 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2</a> Instances and 2 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">Amazon RDS</a> databases. The calculation is solely based on weekly hours required to run the Project. The bigger your Project, the more hours needed in a week to manage it.  The more Indalit Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/all-project-management-services/">Services</a> you take, the more hours needed in a week to do them.  The more <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS Services</a> you want, the more hours needed to organise the tasks. It's all about the hours a week.

### Our Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a>

The Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">PLANS</a> have been well designed and most should find in one of them what they require.  But it's always nice to have the option for more.  There are 3 situations in which you would consider the Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a>:

<ol style="color:#d84315">
	<li><span style="color:grey">Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">Plan</a> + Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a> (You pick a Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">Plan</a> and add one or more Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a> deliverables because your business requires them.</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a> for management your project (<a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/#essential">Essential Plan</a> will be added, the Project Manager has some tasks he cannot remove to be able to do his job correctly.)</li>
	<li><span style="color:grey">One or more Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a> (Get a few deliverables for an existing project not managed by us.) </li>
</ol>

More information on Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a>.


### Our Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-value-added-services/">Value Added Services</a> - Going Beyond Project Management

This is where we stand out.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, a few years back, realized technically they where pretty good.  They built a great e-commerce platforme that was serving, not sure of the numbers, a crazy amount of customers all over the world.  So someone had the idea, why not sell our expertise?  And from that came AWS and the empire it has become.  It's the same for us.  To create a methodology that was adapted to the constraints of the IT industry and Cloud Services Provider, a lot of work was done, processes put in place, documentation, templates and so much more.  It had to work large scale, it had to be adapted to the IT recruiting difficulties, to integrate project team members that mostly work from different locations, to handle very demanding customer and so much more.  So many of our Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-value-added-services/">Value Added Services</a> come from the whole Indalit proccess.  Training sessions is an example of them.

One of the key character traits of project managers is that they can get things done even if they have never done it before and don't know how, or have no training on the subject, in the end they will make it happen.  They don't resist change like many do, they are leaders and leaders move forward.  With this sort of attitude, we decided to offer some Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-value-added-services/">Value Added Services</a> that are outside of the normal Project Management scope simply because we have the experience and knowledge to do much more.

For a more detailed description of offering, click here Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-value-added-services/">Value Added Services</a>.


### Pricing

Calculated # of hours per week and # of weeks.
But how do we know how many hours a week is necessary?

Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">PLANS</a>: Pricing is based on number of hours a week you need and the number of weeks you reserve them for.  Price is degressive.  Minimum 7 hours a week for a minimum of 1 month.  This is for Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/all-project-management-services/">Services</a> where you take a Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-plans/">Plan</a>. 
<br /><br />
Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a>: Price is per hour, each option has a minimum number of hours.  Price here is based on the work that needs to be done, the size of the solution and the complexity of each {Cloud Service}.
<br /><br />
Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-value-added-services/">VALUE ADDED SERVICES</a>: They are priced similarly to the Project Management <a href="/project-management-services/project-management-custom-options/">Custom Options</a>, based on work load, the infrastructure size and the complexity of each {Cloud Service}.  We even have one training session that is free because it will make the project must smoother.

Lack of Skills/Knowledge.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Internal staff not Cloud Ready.  But worse, not interested to change, change is a scary word.  And this is for all your departments, Engineering of course, but HR, Sales, Marketing, Provisioning, Finance,...
<br />
We have training sessions to get people going.  {How Amazing is the Cloud?}, {Introduction to Cloud Providers}, {Introduction to AWS}, {Technical Introduction to AWS}, {Finally I Learn the Basics of IT},... all these are presentations to get you started.  They are designed to motivate and show the positive aspects.  From there, we can build a training path for your employees with sepcialized training centers or self-learning.  With the goal of having a few certifications.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Following the previous point, your teams are not ready but you need to move forward.  We will work with you to find the resources you require to get this project done.  In the {Idea Phase} or {Initiate Phase}, once we have identified a few suppliers we can work with, we use an {RFI} and/or {RFP} to gather the necessary information to enable us to choose the right one.  We also create the {Supplier Assessment Checklist} that matches your requirements.

From Project Idea to Production there is too much to do.

We start with you a bit earlier in the project process to provide support and guidance from the moment you have an idea or many.  And we go beyond the {Implementation Phase} to assist you on a day to day basis for the first couple of months, {Assist Phase}.  You can be certain that we cover all aspects of your project.

There are so many options, how do we know what to choose?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We will analyse with you the possible options adapted to your requirements.  This will be done working with your teams or the suppliers.  Based on the goal of your project, we can choose the options most relevant to start with.  We can keep a "nice to have" list and plan this in multiple stages.  This should ideally be done in the {Initiate Phase}.

How much will it cost?

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We price out the whole solution for you, recurring and implementation.  We can then adjust both to match your budgets before even starting the project.  No surprises.

If we where involved early enough in your project, we can make sure the solution proposed is the one that will work.  It is easy to follow a budget, but the problems come from badly planned projects where not enough effort was put into an initial audit and design.  Once the project has been approved, the suppliers chosen, the infrastructure designed, the project manager can only manage the budget based on the assumption that everything was done correctly before.  Often the project manager is brought in too late.

As mentionned before, we offer training sessions aimed to helping people want to make the change.

But in the end, some people will be completely resistent to change.

We will prepare all the necessary documents that will allow you to present the project in a very professional way.  All will be covered and should answer all their questions and doubts.  It's not a guarantee of approval, but definetely a way of giving the project the best chance possible.

</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We work with suppliers like this.  We have put in place a process to make it work which we can adapt to all non-english speaking technicians.  This will require someone on their side who does speak english, it will take some time to setup and will be more intensive to manage, but it is possible.  Considering you pay 900€/day for an AWS Solutions Architect, you could find the same level of expertise starting at 250€/day.  For some this can be worth the hassle.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 15%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Project management can be expensive, can we do without?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Some would say on a small project you can do without, but in any case you will need someone to be the main contact if you want it to work.  Noone to take the role of a Project Manager will cause delays, budgets will not be followed, people won't be managed, and in the end, even if your project is a success, there will be many aspects missing and the project will most likely have taken longer and cost more than planned.  To help with this, we offer Project Management on a per hour a week basis.  If you only need 10 hours, then you don't have to pay the full price of a Project Manager.  On the other hand, you need a full time Project Manager, we will most likely be less expensive then market rates.  Our prices are based on the number of hours taken a week and the number of months of the contract.  In both situations, you will pay less going with us.

On our last project, we lost control over it.  How can we avoid this happening?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Get us involved at an early stage of the process.  Ideally during the {Idea Phase}.  The more the Project Manager is involved, the better he can do his job.  Our methodology is completely adapted to Cloud Services and we have experience in this.  As long as you take the right number of hours of Project Management, there is no reason to lose control over the project.

Moving to the Cloud, we are affraid of Vendor Lock-In.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
This problem has nothing to do directly with a Cloud solution.  If you went with a traditional hoster you would have the same problem.  If this is something you are afraid of then consider an on-premises solution.  But it is true that if you use the full extent of Cloud Services available to you, then moving will be more difficult than a traditional hoster which offers very little services.  What we can do for you to limit this, is to be involved early in your project, the {Idea Phase} and we can investigate a multi-cloud solution.  This will most likely cost more to setup, but can give you some peace of mind.

We think the Cloud is less secure than on-premises or a traditional hosting solution.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
This can only be analysed on a case by case basis.  On-premises security definitely rarely meets the security standards of a Cloud Provider.  As for traditional hosting, it really depends.  It is true you will probably have a lot of data on the Cloud.  It can be encrypted at rest and encrypted in transit, does your traditional hoster do this?  This is just an example.  But if you need to be reassured, we can analyze your security requirements and see how the Cloud Provider you choose deals with it.

Managing Multiple Cloud Services
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
One, two or more Cloud Providers doesn't change anything for us.  All we need is the time to manage it.  The role of a Project Manager is to manage people, so they can be working on different aspects of the project, that won't affect us in any way.

We've been told it is very complex to build a Cloud Solution.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Entirely depends on your project.  A simple e-commerce migration will be easy, a change of methodology, technology like moving your applications to a serverless solution will obviously be more complex.  But for us, it's the same except there are more milestones/tasks/steps to manage.  That is our role.

Will my Cloud Solution have better performance than my current one?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Again, if we are included in the project early on, we can plan for a POC and test various performance indicators.  The only constraint is this needs to be planned early on because if the outcome is negative, the whole project will be affected.  The order of things will be adapted to the fact there is a POC in the project.

We have been told that the monthly cost keep going up when on a Cloud Solution, but that the cost of the traditional hosting is fix.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
This is a perfect example of needing to do things in a new way once you have moved to the Cloud.  You need to start with calculating the cost per unit (unit being # of customers, of users, or transactions...)  Month to month you compare that cost.  If it goes up, then something is wrong, but normally it should go down.  We can help you create your monthly financial analysis for your Cloud Solution.  Just to give you some background on this, when you have a traditional hosting solution your prices are fixed.  When traffic goes up and your site slows down, you loose some users/customers or whatever, you infrastructure is unable to adapt.  On a Cloud Solution, which was designed correctly, a boost in traffic means more users/customers since the infrastructure adapts to this burst.  In the end you usually have more users/customers that come directly from this ability to adapt to traffic.  You can add to this less downtime, less attacks, ... and it is normal to expect some growth when moving to the Cloud.

We have done our own cost analysis and a Cloud Solution is not cheaper.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We can do one for you.  We have done many and thus have experience in this.  It is unusual for a Cloud Solution to be more expensive than an on-premises one or a traditional hosting one.  A few errors in calculating the cost are usually done which make a big difference on the bottom line.  First, when you buy servers, you generally pay upfront or maybe lease them over X number of years.  You need to compare with the same type of pricing plan.  So if you pay upfront, the compare with the Cloud Providers pricing plan that matches this.  Most people calculate with the on-demand cost which are very expensive compared to paying a full upfront for a 3 years contract.  This is usually where the mistake is made.  Then, you are moving to the Cloud, there are all these new amazing services, so you take a couple of them that will in the end take you less time to manage, save you some money on other aspects like licensing and so on.  But when you make your calculation, you can't compare apples with pears.  A new service that is not part of your current infrastructure cannot be calculated in your cost analysis.  Also, depending on the Cloud Provider, the cost of services can be very difficult to estimate.  The whold Cloud Solutions is an amazing revolution, a new way of doing things much more efficiently.  The Cloud Providers have done a great job at creating inovative services, quality and usability as primary characteristics.  But, how to calculate the actual cost of your future infrastructure can be a nightmare.  It often gives you the impression they used all their good energy in developping amazing services, then they had nothing left and did crazy things with calculating costs.

What about maintenance, operation, support, change management...?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
We can plan for this in the project, choose the suppliers, help with training your teams, assist you in the first couple of months of production, build your processes and much more.  In the end, one day you wake up and think maybe we should move to the Cloud, then you get us involved right then and this will be the easiest project you have ever worked on.

How do we pick the right Cloud Provider?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Easy, we identify all the requirements, create a {Supplier Assessment Checklist}, write a good and complete {RFP} and we will analyze which one or ones answer to all or most of your requirements.  It's simply a well planned analysis.

We have a huge project, we don't know where to start.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
You can see it as a huge project and be completely overwhelmed by it, or as a multitude of small ones.  The {Waterfall} project management methodology which delivers a project in one big band approach is avoided when possible.  Now we are more in the era of {Continuous Delivery}/{Continuous Integration}.  What this means is we try to deliver in increments, small chuncks at a time.  In the end, this make take a bit more time, but you have much more chances of success then a big bang delivery.  We will plan for more deliveries but smaller ones.  This methodology is based on the {Agile Manifesto}.

Testing cost money and is often inadequate, how can we avoid this?
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Testing is expensive.  If you test every step of the way, you need someone to design the tests, perform them, get any issues fixed and then start testing again until it works.  Tests should be planned and prepared, another reason to make sure you involve your Project Manager early one.  We can have the tests created, we can manage a mix of tests being prepared by the suppliers, your teams and your Project Manager, your Project Manager can create the tests and cherry on the cake, we have some tests ready for different services.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: top; width: 85%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Obviously it should be part of your project, but in the case you can't afford a proper DR solution, we can help you build a solution on paper.  What does this mean?  Well, you will have a complete "How To" to build a DR site on the fly in X amount of time.  This obviously can take a lot of time, but much less than if it wasn't planned.  For example have all the {Server Images} ready.  Have all the options of a services identified with correct values and so on.

# The Indalit People

We have a team of Project Managers as per you might expect.  We give them an environment in which they can learning and evolve.  In this industry where resources are scarce, it is important to provide the best work conditions possible.  Our goal is for them to work in a good environment in terms of physical aspects (office, desks,...), possibility to learn, evolution in position and responsibility, good interpersonal relationships with other staff members but also with customers, incentive to do better, good salaries and most importantly we want them to enjoy their work.  All this in an amazing city that lives under the sun and next to the sea.  What could be better?


<!-- **************** -->

## What is A Great Project Manager?

One that gets things done and the customer is satisfied.

<!-- **************** -->

## What Is The Training/Background of the Project Managers?

Specific character traits are looked for during the recruitment process.  This takes the lead over studies and experience.  Some of us are born Project Managers and that is who we want.  Obviously Project Managers don't need to be Solution Architects but still need to best possible understanding of IT technologies and Cloud Services.  The engineers will provide the schedule as to how much time is required for a task, but this is often very much overestimated when it comes from suppliers and underestimated when in comes from your internal teams.  So the Project Manager needs to be able to judge if the estimations are accurate.

### Training

Intensive.  We have an extensive training path with various exams, accreditations and certifications.  Depending on the experience and knowledge of the recruit, the training start from a few weeks to a few months to get the accreditations and certifacations.

### Personal Study Path

In IT you need to learn all the time, and Project Managers are not exceptions to this.  We have put in place a system to allow for training, learning and teaching.  This is both an investment from Indalit and the Project Manager.  

### Accreditations and Certifications

Many, many...  We obviously can't to them all.  Based on knowledge and experience we will adapt the requirements to each Project Manager.  The aim is to have at least one per Cloud Provider we support.

### Technical Discovery

Learn, learn, learn, but how?  For non technical staff it's not always easy to take on a new technology or service and figure it out.  We have build a {Technical Discovery Process} which guides our Project Managers through this learning process.  Just read and search the internet, follow the steps, answer the questions and in the end they will have acquired a new skill.
