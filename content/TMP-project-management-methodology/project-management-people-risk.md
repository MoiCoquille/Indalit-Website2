###  Managing Risks in Project Management

There is so much around risk, issue, problem management that we often forget the most important of them all, PEOPLE.  You can plan around an electrical failure, have a backup plan, secondary electricity provider and so on.  But people are the center of it all.  They make the difference between a project that fails and one that is a success.  So before creating your usual project Risks & Issues log, consider how to deal with the biggest risks and issues of them all.

As Project Manager, risks, issues, problems, constraints, delays are what we manage daily, it is our role to see these and plan around them.  But for some reason we never really add in our Risks Log the fact that the people on the project don't read their emails correctly.  Even if in the end this probably has a bigger incidence on the failure of a project.  To deal with the People Risks, you need to identify them, know how to see them in people, and mostly know how to minimize the negative effects they can have on your project.

First, we'll identify them and then see what actions to take to counter them.  Once you accept the People Risks, then you can handle them.  We do not live in the wonderfull world of the Care Bares.  There are main character traits that obviously are not applicable to everyone.  But they exist and a Project Manager should know who to deal with them.

People are late.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Start without them.  Let them know they are late and ask them not to be next time, obviously in a deplomatic manner.  People are not use to being told when they have a bad behaviour, you will be surprised to see that when it happens, they usually listen and take it into account when it is not said in an aggressive or an accusatory manner.

</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Break down the tasks into smaller tasks.  if they receive a question, then you have a chance they might answer it right away, but if the receive a questionnaire, then for sure they will put it aside for later.

People think they are smarter than the others.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Let them think that, no point in breaking there bubble and anyway, they wouldn't be receptive to it not being true.  This is where your political abilities come into play and use flatery if necessary.  In the end, you need something from them and you need to find the way to get it.  But, and there is a big BUT, in the process don't diminish yourself.  If you can't get this person to do their work because they think they are above it, then escalate.

Repeat, repeat, repeat, write, email, call, repeat.  Don't assume because you said it once during the kickoff meeting that they will still remember two months down the line.

People don't read.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
This is a big one.  As Project Managers you are tought to communicate intensivily, but in the end, all the documentations written and the emails and the meeting minutes are generally ignored or read diagonaly.  This means you can't assume the people know something.  Ok, it is their responsibility if they don't take the time to read properly, but in the end, the success of the project is your unique goal.  
Be concise, highlight the important parts, provide a quick extract of the main points, do what you need to make sure they read the things you want them to.
Assigning responsibility can be a good option.  Also requesting feedback or asking a question about what was read.

Say it nicely, no need to copy everyone on it.  Even better call, don't write it.  
Point out the consequences of what they are doing wrong instead of pointing at them.  If they feel attacked, they will close up and not listen to anything.

People are too often incompetent.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Lack of time, knowledge, guidance ends up in incompetence.  Needing help is not well regarded, so people don't say when they can't.  
Provide guidance, indicate where they can get what they need to do it better.  Give them a chance to fix it.

<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
This gets worse if you play the game.  You delagate, not take on responsibilities for others.  
Give them hints, but never do it for them.

Explain again dividing into many points.  Go through them one by one and only move on to the next one when the current one is understood.  Break it down, this fixes a lot of things.

People will always choose the easy way.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Try making the easy way be what you want.  In the end, you want something, then it is your responsibility to do what is necessary to get what you want.  If you need to spend more time preparing a form or something, then go ahead.  Make it easy.  Now, if it is something they are responsible for, they have to do it, then no need to take that extra time to make it easy.

They will not take the time to learn.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
In todays business word, people tend to be very busy.  Learning means either not working during the time you are learning or doing it on your own time after work.  Now we may know that learning is a personal development and not the responsibility of your employer, but still, people expect it to be easy.  In the end, you can't learn it for them.  
For the small things, break down your instructions or information into small chunks and put them as bullet points.  Make it easy.

And then people do something amazing!  They are human.
</td>
<td style="padding: 6px; vertical-align: center; width: 70%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Be ready to be surprised.  As a Project Manager you see all the problems, risks, issues, delays, ...  But in the end your projects are all a success.  No matter how bad people may appear to be individually, as a group they can surpass themselves.  Macro view, not micro.  If you look at a human from 5 meters away, they can be beautiful, if you look at them 5 cm away, then there not so beautiful.
