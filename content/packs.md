<h4 class="font04">
What is the AWS Pricing Package?
</h4>

<h5 class="font03">
The world of AWS is amazing, we won't go over that right not.  But understanding pricing is not as simple as one may have thought.  So a solution has been presented to you by us or someone else and you now need to know how much it cost?  We calculate the price of your solution.
</h5>

<div class="br-01">
<br />
</div>


<h4 class="font04">
What will it bring to you?
</h4>

<h5 class="font03">
First of all peace of mind, if you where to do it yourself, you'd be surprised by the complexity.  A sort of quote you may require internally.  And an overall appreciation of the cost reduction you will make with AWS.

What is included?
</h4>

  <div class="col-md-4">
<h4 class="font08">Investigation</h4>
<h4 class="font03">To price correctly, we will need to know a lot of little details about your expected usage.  We will work with your teams to gather this data.</h4>
</div>

<div class="col-md-4">
<h4 class="font08">Duration</h4>
In this package 4 to 6 hours of work by a Certified Solutions Architect is included.  It may seem like a lot of hours just to price a solution, but it actually takes quite a bit of time.
</div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
<h4 class="font08">First Estimate</h4>
<h4 class="font03">Through a Video Conference Call, we will present the estimate and explain it in details.  At this stage you might be surprised and wish to make modifications to fit within a budget.</h4>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
<h4 class="font08">Second Estimate</h4>
<h4 class="font03">We often get over excited when building a solution but when it comes time to price it, we calm down rapidely.  This second estimate might be required to get a better price or to be able to compare.  Do note this is not a second solution that is priced, but the inicial one with minor modifications.</h4>
</div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
<h4 class="font08">Caveats</h4>
<h4 class="font03">Pricing is provided based on AWS website.  We have no tool or application that allows us to have the most accurate prices.  Also good thing to note is we do not work for AWS and receive no commission from them, so no point in trying to negotiate.  Pricing is stricktly provided based on usage predictions given by your teams.  These numbers may not represent the reality.</h4>
