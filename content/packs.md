What is the AWS Presentation Bundle?
</h4>

The AWS Presentation Bundle provides you with a complete presentation of AWS and it's most important services.  This is not really a technical presentation, but you do need to understand the basics of IT.  Included will be the addition of a pre-defined topic that you especially want to cover.  It will be followed by a Questions & Answers session and a second follow-up session on the points that need to be cleared.
