What is DevOps? Long story short, DevOps means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment">R.O.I</a>., the days of the mutable infrastructure are gone. With cloud infrastructure and moreover ephemeral instances, immutable platforms are the new norm. Get ready to put aside chaos and enter the world of predictivity.
