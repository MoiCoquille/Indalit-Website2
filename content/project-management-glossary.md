Centralized Document Management / System
</th>
<td style="width: 80%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
In the <i>CPM</i>, Cloud Solutions Project Management Methodology, the Project Manager manages the documentation of the project.  This is the documentation from everyone.  Since all have access to the <i>Project Management System</i>, it makes sense that it is available there.  The Project Manager also manages his own documentation, but in a specific way.  There is <i>Master Data</i> which is the actual data that is used in other documents.  This is the data that is kept up to date.  In the <i>Master Data</i> there is no duplicates.  This is the data that needs to always be kept updated.

<td style="width: 80%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
When there is a dispute or disagreement it may be necessary for the Project Manager to step in.  The Conflict Resolution Process, or document, will give the guidelines as to how to handle the problem.  With it, he should be able to put an end to the dispute or disagreement.

It takes the best from many existing methodologies, adapts them to Cloud Services and takes into account the scarce resources issue and massive migrations that are coming over the next five years.

As per CPM, any information is kept in a single location without repetition.  This data is then copy/pasted into other documents when required, never composed twice nor keep many primary versions of the same data.  Most document are written once for a specific purpose and then are put aside once they've served their purpose, no need to update these.  But some documents need to be up to date, and they get their data from the <i>Master Data</i>.

Phase
</th>
<td style="width: 80%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
For clarity and simplicity, our <i>Project Management Methodology</i> is divided into multiple phases, 9 in this case including Sales.  We have more <i>Phases</i> because we offer more services a regular Project Manager would, we include Sales because a Project Manager is also involved and in the end it is easier to work in <i>Phases</i> then it is in one big chunk.  As a customer, you can choose the <i>Phases</i> you want for your project (within some limits).
<br />
For more information on <i>Phases</i> read <a href="/project-management-methodology/#phase">Methodology</a>.

A bundle of many elements of the <i>CPM</i>, <i>Project Management Methodology</i>.  It is a Sales/Marketing elaboration to facilitate you in choosing the services you want.  The <i>Plans</i> are divided in three:
<br />
<br />
<ul>
	<li><span>Essential Plan</li>
	<li><span>Prime Plan</li>
	<li><span>Integral Plan</li>
</ul>
<i>Essential</i> being the entry level one and the two others build on the previous one.  When choosing a <i>Plan</i> you can also choose some <i>Custom Options</i> to add to the services you require.

After a <i>Phase</i> and a <i>Step</i> you will find <i>Tasks</i>.  They are actions, things to be done.  They can be very general like "Install Storage Solution" or very precise like "Configure Lifecycles in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">AWS S3</a>".

</th>
<td style="width: 80%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
During a project you have the <i>Daily Operations</i> that cover the foundation documentation to be produced.  These are the ones found in the <i>Essential Plan</i>i>.  For the other documentation, actions and/or tasks are usually provisioned in a certain number of hours per week.  If these hours run out and there are still some urgent, then the Project Manager will remove time from <i>Daily Ops</i> to get them done.  In the end, the Project Manager will do everything necessary to avoid delays even if that means one week with no reporting.

Technical Discovery Form
</th>
<td style="width: 80%; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
Part of our <a href="/project-management-methodology/">Project Management Methodology</a>, we have this form.  A <i>Project Manager</i> always has to learn new things, there is no way around it.  Even with experience and knowledge, there are always new technologies, IT services, software, protocols... that he doesn't know.  Learning a new "technical thing" takes time.  To make the learning process more efficient, we use this form.  You follow the steps in the form and at the end you have assimilated a new "technical thing".  It's not magic, it takes time to go through the form and may require completing a second or third for when the action subject contains multiple elements.  An example would be going high level like "I need to learn <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">AWS S3</a>".  To do that you might need to understand what objects are and what <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/" target="_blank">AWS Glacier</a> is to understand the full extent of <i>AWS S3</i>.  If you want to understand routing and routers, then you need to learn IP first.  In the end it all depends on how deep you go, the form lets you go as deep as you want.
